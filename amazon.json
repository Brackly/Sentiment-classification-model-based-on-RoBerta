    "text": "My old Ipad Pro hasn\u2019t worked for over a year and I also needed a new computer -  but didn\u2019t need anything as sophisticated as a Mac so thought I would try out this 9th Gen Ipad.  So far it does most of what I would do with a larger laptop and has a touchscreen.  I was reluctant to buy Apple tech for quite a few years until I bought a small Iphone SE about 4 years ago - switched from a Samsung Galaxy..  The SE was a great size to carry around the city and it fit in most pockets and had great reception.  It was and still is a great piece of technology.  I upgraded to a 12 after 2 years and still use the SE around the house because it connects to wifi.  The 12 had a better camera and I had toddler granddaughters and after another 2 years I upgraded to the 14 PROMax which has a great camera, larger screen and is not unlike the SE except the bigger size to view photos.  I really love the touchscreen feature for NYTimes games and other interactive apps.  I worry about having most of my pictures on this technology because they could move to a more sophisticated system and make these obsolete - which is a concern. My daughter\u2019s Iphone 13 fell in the snow a few years ago and she somehow lost all her pictures that she thought were in the cloud.  I held on to my 12 because it holds quite a bit of what she lost since we shared their photos.  Neither of us is sure why this happened and if it could happen again.  If I have a stand alone camera it isn\u2019t convenient but I have the photos detached from the technology and the whims of a large multinational behemoth.  So far I am happy with the Ipad and am still learning how to use it.  I found a case that closes securely and  can stand in portrait or landscape mode which is really nice when viewing Netflix or AppleTV.  If you need a new computer to carry conveniently this Ipad is the way to go unless you really need the power and graphic abilities of the MAC.  My Iphone 14maxpro has 256g of memory and I barely use 100 so I thought I would only need 64g on the Ipad since my phone has the extra capacity.  Not convinced this was a great decision but some of my Iphone content can stay there exclusively  so it might just work out.  Or not\u2026..",

    "text": "My previous iPad still operates [testimony to Apple\u2019s amazing quality] but it is so old (2012 3rd Gen) it will only run a couple of the apps I enjoy using.  I had stopped using it years ago and grew accustomed to using my iPhone and multiple Mac computers instead.  However, several months back I decided to explore streaming music with a WiiM Pro and felt I needed a larger screen than my iPhone to control the WiiM and read about the music I was listening to via Qobuz.  So I decided to get a new iPad but didn\u2019t need a laptop replacement (i.e., lots of processing power), or cutting edge screen.  And I wanted a \u201cGoldilocks\u201d size.  At around $250 this 9th Gen iPad is a fantastic bargain.It doesn\u2019t have the heft or quality feel of my 3rd Gen, which is made out of steel, but it seems well put together.  The screen is only a tiny, tiny bit better but for what I do the screen is fine.  It\u2019s plenty bright and responsive.  And, of course, it runs every app I choose to use flawlessly.  A few attributes blow me away, however.  Even with what\u2019s now a slightly older processor (A13) it is very fast.  Battery life is staggering.  This iPad is so satisfying, I have switched my usage away from my phone, and even my TV\u2019s to it.  It\u2019s fantastic as a control device for the WiiM, great for recreational web surfing, and I have been using it as a display device for Xfinity Stream to watch local TV.  It\u2019s also perfect for watching YouTube videos.It\u2019s hard to emphasize enough what a screaming bargain this is now - mid 2013.",

    "text": "Me compre este m\u00f3vil de salida y no me a fallado en nada, la c\u00e1mara es brutal, los videos que hace son tremendos guacho no te lo pienses mas, si tienes un s22 ultra y tienes problemas de bater\u00eda no dudes en comprar este, ya que la autonom\u00eda que posee es mucho mayor a la de su predecesor, adem\u00e1s cuenta con los marcos mas planos lo cual lo hace mas facil de sostener y no tienes ese sentido de que se te va a resbalar, yo venia anteriormente de un s22+ y tenia muchos problemas con la autonom\u00eda y este celular esta de locos.La pantalla tiene colores extraordinarios sin duda de las mejores pantallas del mercado a d\u00eda de hoy. Muy buenos \u00e1ngulos de visi\u00f3n y nivel de brillo que en pleno sol siempre podr\u00e1s ver el contenido de la pantalla.El rendimiento en juegos no tiene nada que ver con el Snapdragon de 1 generaci\u00f3n ya que se calentaba demasiado y su rendimiento ca\u00eda en picada. Con este nuevo Snapdragon gen2 no tengo esos problemas ya que se calienta muy poco y su refrigeraci\u00f3n mejorada logra muy buena estabilizaci\u00f3n de rendimiento en jornadas mas largas. Lo prob\u00e9 en genshin impact, tower of fantasy y en muchos otros juegos muy demandantes y en todos los juego puedo decir que no bajo de los 60fps y era algo que con el Snapdragon de gen1 no pod\u00eda decir.En cuanto a el tama\u00f1o, si te gustan los m\u00f3viles peque\u00f1os no te recomiendo comprarlo este celular es inmenso y en lo personal es lo que me encanta, si tienes manos peque\u00f1as te ser\u00e1 dif\u00edcil usarlo con solo una mano pero igualmente lo puedes usar.Si te conectas a dispositivos bluetooth como parlantes, televisiones, aud\u00edfonos nunca tuve ninguna interrupci\u00f3n de conexi\u00f3n .Los parlantes son muy contundentes suenan fuerte y con buen bajo. A volumen m\u00e1ximo no se distorsiona el sonido.",

    "text": "I recommend this phone if you have the money or wait for a good deal. I have the 12gb of ram with the 512gb of storage and I have only had maybe one or two problems, but that was on the first update of One Ui 5.1 where the phone was connected to wifi and I did not get any internet access and I had to restart my phone but besides that the phone is very fast and snappy. The cameras are very great quality and the display is as well. The Phone also charges very fast and the battery will last me into the next day or more. I might be wrong but the battery life on this phone is probably the best on the market at the moment. Samsung is not selling the exynos chip sets with these phones this year which is good because snapdragon has proven to be way better. The S-pen is very useful for photo editing, taking photos, taking notes, and even drawing. Sometimes I'll connected the phone to a display and use DEX to watch a movie and I use the S-pen as a remote. The phone also very obviously integrated with Google. You dont have to us the Samsung applications on this phone because it runs on android but the Samsung apps are also very useful. Software experience is very smooth as well. Very easy to use.",

    "text": "The phone I received was unlocked but not \"factory unlocked\". It is a T-Mobile version of the phone that is \"carrier unlocked\". The T-Mobile splash screen comes up on boot-up, meaning it has the T-Mobile version of the Android firmware. However, it does work with my cell phone service provider (AT&T, GSM) so not a deal breaker but it is annoying.The fingerprint reader in the front screen is pretty bad. It won't let you scan your thumb diagonally positioned on the screen like when you hold the phone and place your thumb over the reader. It has to be perfectly vertical. That makes no sense. So to unlock I have to use two hand to position my thumb and hold the phone then move the phone back to one hand. Very odd.I used the iPhone 12 mini for several months and it has has pretty bad battery life compared to many smartphones (due to smaller battery size). This phone is horrible on battery life. If used during the day, it will not last until the end of the day. I must have a charger around. I have all apps optimized, screen set to 60Hz (not the high end 120Hz) and enabled all the other tips found on Youtube. Still barely lasts all day. And it has a 4000mAh battery! This should be an embarrassment for Samsung. My last Samsung Galaxy S8 was AWESOME but alas all the carriers went to Voice over LTG (VoLTE) and that phone did not support it (planned obsolescence in action). Now I have a phone that has worse battery life, worse fingerprint reader and just a marginally better camera. I'm not sure if that is progress.",

    "text": "I'm not sure why people are complaining about texting, fingerprint reader with a thick screen protector, or carrier incompatibility issues. I popped in my T-Mobile SIM Card and everything worked instantly. No issues with texting. If you've applied a thick tempered glass screen protector, just hit the touch screen sensitivity increase switch in the settings and then set your fingerprint and it works perfectly. This phone is great, and I'm not sure why anyone would pay $150 bucks more to get it from the other seller as this one works in the U.S. This seller shipped it out to me fast and I verified that it was brand new in the box. I upgraded from my Galaxy S7 edge, and everything just works faster and smoother, the camera takes excellent pics and video in daylight and low light conditions. It works just like my edge so everything is very familiar which is what I wanted - nothing revolutionary but reliable and comfortable. No glitches or hiccups when using any app. Battery life is about the same as my edge, which means it lasts at least two days with normal use. I compared this against the S22 line, but with the things I read about the non-ultra versions skimping on features and having worse specs and dismal battery life, it wasn't worth the extra $700 bucks. The only thing I really don't like is that Samsung has eliminated the removal micro SD card slot, so managing storage on the cloud is a hassle. I used to love swapping out 256GB cards. I use this a lot to document all my family vacations, and I would hate to run out of battery while out on a long day tour. Do yourself a favor and pick this one up if you're looking for a solid, non-gimmicky Galaxy phone that just works and doesn't feel outdated compared to the new fancy lineup of smartphones coming out on the market (like the Fold 4).",

Ultimately I had to give up on this phone and not being able to get used to Samsung oriented apps also pushed my decisions in that direction. I really wanted give Samsung a chance but I just couldn't do it.

I can get the $60 back from Mint Mobile but I have to eat the $35 for straight talk. Please make sure these phones are 100% unlocked before you sell them! I believe mine is not!

Long lasting 5000ma battery. This phone also includes a radio which the USA 64gb model does not. I added a 1tb microsd card for an awesome amount of storage. I also love the fact that it has a 3.5mm headphone jack to which I am able to insert and use a Shure SM58 dynamic microphone for recording videos. In order to use a dynamic microphone with your phone you have to purchase a Startech MUYHSMFF Headset Adapter W/ Microphone and Headphone Splitter. Best to order the Startech from someplace other than here because they sent the wrong cable three times in a row. Special thanks to unitblocks for their review of this particular Samsung A14 5G here on Amazon because the company that is listing the phone, MVD Mobile, has the wrong specs in their listing. Without the review of unitblocks I never would have found this phone here in the USA though I searched the internet extensively for this model which is Model SM-A146M. This model is made for Latin America. When you begin to set-up the phone it is set for Spanish but simply select English United States and you're good to go. Now for sale here on Amazon for $179.00 (as of July 3, 2023). I LOVE THIS PHONE! It has saved me hundreds of dollars over those mid-range phone offerings and provides features that some more expensive phones do not (headphone jack, radio, 128gb internal storage, microsd expansion).",

I would not of bought it with out their great warranty because I have no clue what it will do next week..  EDIT on 2/3/23 Battery health is down to 95%  2/16 94% everything running in the back has been turned OFF , I am an elderly woman and barely even use this phone. I took it to talk to somebody at Best Buy and they told me that the battery should NOT be going down this fast it\u2019s a bad sign of prior abuse ,, at this rate my battery will hit 80% pretty fast ,.so I guess I\u2019m going to return it\u2026  no more renewed refurbishment the geek guy at Best Buy said..  it is having some weird glitches hope that doesn\u2019t continue.. I was hoping the percentage would of stopped how fast is going down.. but it\u2019s not",

    "text": "I had the iPhone SE 2020 as my first iPhone and I had it for three years. So I only really have that phone to compare the iPhone 13 Pro Max to, but the 13PX is the winner by a landslide. Despite this phone being refurbished, it is in excellent condition which is what I ordered and happily received. The only thing I noticed about it was there were a few TINY scratches on the screen\u2026with a screen on or with a screen cover it\u2019s not even noticeable! The battery came in 100% health, and after about 15 hours of screen time, I did all you can imagine: social media (including taking pictures and videos), music streaming, video streaming such as YouTube and Prime Video, and adding widgets to my phone that may use more battery power\u2026the battery lasted all day!! I haven\u2019t had that in a phone ever I don\u2019t think. I am planning to have this phone all four years of college, and I don\u2019t think it will disappoint.The biggest complaint I see about this phone is how heavy people say it is which made me hesitant to get it\u2026but while it may be heavier than the average phone, it is also bigger than most phones and that is why. But seriously, it\u2019s worth it because you will get used to it after a day and it\u2019s really not a big deal. I am a weak girl with hands that only hold about 1/2 the phone while typing and I can handle it lol. The only problem I can really think of is that the phone may be difficult to fit in women\u2019s pockets\u2026but that\u2019s why most of us have purses or bags with us so it\u2019s solvable.However, since the phone is larger, you might be worried about safety\u2026get a phone case and tempered glass screen protector (some even include protectors for your back cameras)! You can find many on Amazon for an inexpensive price.If you\u2019re concerned about your privacy, I would recommend trying out privacy screen protectors that dim or block out light when you look at the screen not head-on, it is a life changer in my opinion.I hope my review was informative and helped you make your decision :)",

Phone was packages in a generic smartphone device box that had an Android logo on it? Odd. Setup went fine and everything is working! Cost was 2/3 of apple refurbished and would have went with apple if what I wanted had been available from apple. So this forces me to try something new, save a little money and hopefully works out well. Haven\u2019t tried to sign this phone to Apple Care but I am not expecting to be available. Gotta say the packaging is really cheezy. I know apple is over the top but this was just totally lacking. First inclination was return it immediately based iPhone in an android boz alone. Decided to resist the paranoia and give it a try.",

    "text": "I declined to leave a unboxing video & picture on this one as its the 2nd device I've bought from this store/seller in a month, technically 3 in total from one of their affiliates. So , I'll start with delivery & packaging , in my profession ( CyberSec/OSINT  ) this is very important detail, it will typically tell the rest of your experience. They did great with shipping times, the got it to me early which is always welcomed and as promised came with a very generic charging block & cable and the device that's about it and it all works great!.  I will also say their after market packaging they used was actually very professional and looked great, sealed with care . There was some paperwork on the side I highly suggest reading as its about your warranty and thus is important.  Remember you pay for what you get, especially with Iphones. I use Android and IOS in business,  I bought a brand new 2021 NEW flagship android device for $320 less than this product but what I paid extra for was that Amazon renewed guarantee which not only promises your device to come with certain prerequisites like over 90% battery life etc BUT it comes with a one year warranty as well as a great return policy which is also a year. I saw alot of mixed reviews , and the details is where you need to look . This company/store did a great job. With its presentation,  Now I'm not going to go to deep I go i to a deep review on the device as a iphone is a iphone,  is a iphone. I have owned every model ,this was a replacement for me aside from business use. This would have been 5 stars all around given the check star system Amazon has in place However,  for example the battery I gave 4 stars, it did come with  90% battery in its bank but like most Iphones unless it's a new battery and has been conditioned ( charged ) properly the battery life is not great on any pro model unless it's the max versions but it will do most great and  as expected. The forest green was a color I loved and was out of stock when I bought it new so that was a nice  addition vs the green iphone 12 pro I have which a total different shade of green. So I bought a bundle , a recommended case and some tempered glass screen protectors,  I will say as they are sufficient,  I made a common mistake as I do like to pay for convienance these bundles are not always the most cost effective route. Do yourself a favor & look around, so  my total was about $730 , the phone itself was priced decent enough but remember that tax is going go be a least $50 added to the device. The phone came 100% Factory Unlocked as advertised and in great shape , the only blemish which I wasn't heartbroken about However for that kind of money and knowing how inexpensive it is to fix the glass as I've done it many of times, there was a decent scratch at the top near the top speaker HOWEVER, I am a tad OCD about things like that especially when spending  that kind of money and having actually bought 3 devices Factory Unlocked I have a high standard. I think most people wont take a 2nd look at it. Just a side note, the resell and value system of used Iphones especially are still very off in 2022 considering for another $150 I could've just bought the iPhone 13 NEW. That said, that has nothing to do with this seller or store just a observation as my business is in all tech. At the end of the day,I can o my fairly go off of what I git & my experience.  I am highly impressed and happy with this purchase. This store/seller took great care in its delivery time, its great packaging, everything came as advertised and product for all Intensive purposes is basically NEW. After 3 devices both IOS & Android , I would not hesitate to do business with this company again. Don't second guess these guys , in reality this was a 5 star sale . They did great business and as I said I was willing to pay more as yes you can find this de ice cheaper all day BUT you are gambling , when it co es to stuff like this I can't stress enough you get what you pay for. The device was perfect, again great presentation,  Factory unlocked,ive tested it on over 20 GSM carriers thus far and I paid for a great product but a peace of mind for a full year , it has a great warranty,  and I have no plans of a return but that option is there if you want it . They did great, I am happy and would buy again!",

    "text": "The phone I received was by all estimations brand new. Not a mark on it and fully charged. However, being new to the Apple World, I can honestly say Windows & Android are both in plain, simple, super easy to understand English. Apple is not. Even its keyboard is not a full Standard Keyboard, like it is with Windows & any Google machine. Android is Google, that's why I say it that way. No getting around it. Just keeping it short & to the point. Apple's iPhone keyboard takes extreme amount of effort to use because it is not the Standard keyboard of every other operating system. Thankfully, I was able to connect a Bluetooth keyboard to it. Otherwise, it's a serious no-go for keyboard use.As for Apple's iPhone Touchscreen, again, I find it sorely lacking. There's no such thing as the simple pinch & zoom on it. That particular luxury seems to be found only within the Camera & Picture sections. You'd think it'd at least be within the iBook section but it's not. On most everything Windows or Google, every app is not just touch & activate, but also affords the luxury of pinch & zoom as well as easy swipe & easy app close & dismiss. Can't say that about the Apple iPhone.And for some unknown reason its WiFi also keeps turning itself on. I can't seem to keep it off no matter how often I manually turn it off.For Apple being so USER-FRIENDLY, I cannot at all say that it is. In fact, IT IS ANYTHING BUT USER-FRIENDLY.  If the Apple World was so user-friendly, then it would be a very simple and easy transition from the Windows or Google platform to Apple. And I can honestly say it is Not at all simple or easy. I was so hoping it would be as simple & easy as my Windows machine & Android phone, but sadly, it's actually quite maddening.If you enjoy Kindle reads, you'll need to install the app for it. But I can also tell you, Apple's iBook seriously pales in comparison to Kindle. Ironically, the Google Search Engine is installed on Apple's iPhone but Kindle is not. I avoid Google anything & everything as much as can be done. But for Apple to deny Amazon's Kindle Apple on its phones, seems almost a crime.I have yet to install the Kindle reading app or to test out the camera on the iPhone. When I do I'll update my review. But currently I can't say it's anything to brag about. And I most certainly did not expect to see Google's Search Engine/Web Browser on it.Size wise, it's the exact same size as my Sony Xperia Z3v. It still functions quite well. Not perfect, but well enough for me since I have it locked to call, text, Kindle reads & camera.  I can easily read, pinch & zoom & highlight my Kindle reads, pictures & text messages on it. Can only do that with pictures on the iPhone. So for it being so great, I actually find it quite limiting. Not because it's an iPhone, but because the Apple creators decided to create a platform that is quite complex and extremely arduous to use. Apple created its own \"language\" that must be learned in order to navigate the complexities of its Eco-system.  Even now, trying to login to the Apple App Store, no keyboard appears so I can actually install Apps necessary for my personal use. Yet you're required to sign in to it. How can you sign into the App Store when NO KEYBOARD APPEARS TO LET YOU?! So, even if I did not want to use the phone feature, but instead use it as a computer tablet, I cannot because it won't let me login to the App Store. ... Like I said, to anyone new to the Apple world, it's quite a infuriatingly maddening conundrum. If Apple wants to gain new customers and retain them, then Apple needs to change how it operates. And if Apple is supposed to be the safest of all online platforms, then it should not sport Google's web browser.The phone I received was/is like brand new. Operating it though, takes considerable patients as it is quite the learning curve. It should not be so difficult to transition from Windows, Android or Google to Apple. They all made sense to everybody from the moment they came out because they were in simple English and easily understood and simple to navigate because of it. Apple on the other hand, not by a long shot. Even Apple's touchscreen capabilities sorely lacks in comparison. And that's sad. You'd think their touchscreen capabilities would be at least on-par with Windows, Google & Android but it is not. You'd think Apple's touchscreen capabilities might even be better than Windows, Android & Google, but no. Thus far I can find nothing to brag about regarding Apple anything. I was so hoping to find something better about Apple. Instead, I'm greatly disappointed and left seriously frustrated.The iPhone itself came fully charged and appears in brand new condition. It also came with an original Apple Charger.I give the seller a stellar 5 star rating, along with the iPhone I received.I give Apple itself a mediocre 3, even 2 star rating.So to anyone new to the Apple world, maybe an iPad would be easier to use. I started with a phone since I need both a new phone & a new computer and figured Apple would be a serious upgrade to Windows and for sure compared to Google's Android. ... Apple is not at all user-friendly to a first time user. Only Windows, Google & Android can actually claim user-friendly bragging rights, from day one for any first time user.Apparently I need either direct Apple support or YouTube's Apple education in order to learn how to make the best use of this phone.  I don't fault the phone for anything. It's an Apple thing. It's very nearly like you gotta go to MIT to learn it. And that's just not right.Will update as I learn how to navigate Apple's world & extremely clunky Eco-system.1st Time Apple iPhone User Assessment. -Phone - good. - can't give it high marks due to Apple itself.Apple - not worth all the money & certainly nothing to brag about.",

    "text": "Bought the 64GB model for $360 in Feb 2021. Still going strong, no slowdown. Bluetooth works great, battery still holds charge all day.I remember the first week I bought it, It felt like I had a cyborg upgrade. The last phone I had had operating system lag whenever interacting with apps. This bad boy is zippy.I use a dual 1440p computer setup and was worried that a 720p LED would be inadequate. The screen looks great. Consider that the tech enthusiasts at Digital Foundry on YouTube still find the switch 720p screen suitable and it is much bigger than this iPhone. You don't need 4K 120hz to have a suitable video watching and light gaming experience when playing stuff like Clash Royale.The camera isn't anything to write home about but it gets the job done. Consider this the best bang for your buck budget phone on the market. I doubt the android phones at the mall will feel this zippy, plus they will be full of bloatware.Also of note is that it interacts with my M1 Mac mini just fine for air dropping.I'll probably continue using it for two years and then splurge on a top of the line device.",

    "text": "This is for me a high-end purchase, really stretching my budget. I chose this camera above all the other Sony models and above all other brands because it seems to me, after reading many reviews, that this camera is not \u201cthe best!\u201d at anything but is very, very good at everything. I\u2019m not trying to pay for the perfect camera or a professional\u2019s camera. I\u2019m trying to get one camera - one investment - to livestream, vlog, record video on vacation, take great pictures of people, nature and landscapes, and astrophotography. One can argue about how this camera or that camera would have been a better choice. This was my choice. Unless you have lots of money or this is your profession, you can only have one camera like this. After two intense weeks of reading and watching many camera reviews during the summer of 2022 the Sony a7iv is where I landed.I will not get into the specifics and technical details about this camera because I\u2019m not the right guy to do it. I\u2019m still learning but I am very, very satisfied with this camera. I also very much like the G Master lenses. They are pricey but they are also very, very good lenses. The G Master f/1.2 50mm prime? Wow!I have to give this camera five stars because it is a jack of all trades even if a master of none. Sony may have saved some of it\u2019s master-class attributes for other more expensive models and that\u2019s fine. For my purposes, a multitool camera is exactly what I wanted.",

    "text": "After a decade or more with my gen 1 A7 I decided to upgrade to the A7IV. If you're coming from a A7II or A7 the upgrade is quite large. The autofocus speed is the biggest thing I noticed immediately. Even older lenses like my 55mm Zeiss is very fast on this camera.The other thing I noticed is how this camera body is about twice as thick as the original A7. If you liked how small the A7 was well... expect the A7IV to be more of the thickness of most other cameras. The thickness from what I understand is the sensor stabilization which by the way the original A7 didn't have. I used to use a monopod with the A7 because no stabilization meant handshake was a very real issue. With the A7IV I can get very sharp images in hand without worry.One other thing. This camera's ISO has some dual sensor business going on. It's both a good and bad thing. It's good because if you shoot at 100ISO or 400ISO your images will look almost identical on noise. The bad is if you shoot at 125, 160, 200, 250 or 320. Someone that doesn't know this may get less sharp images when you need to increase ISO over 100. Do yourself a favor and just shoot at 100 and 400 for most instances then over 400 as usual.I noticed reviewers complaining about the camera menu, but if your coming from another A7 you'll understand the menu quite easily.All other specs were about what I expected. The massive increase in AF points, better video recording, full HDMI slot, dual SD card slots, etc. Also no wall charger for battery... really Sony? Don't be Apple please.",

    "text": "I can't emphasize enough how amazing this camera is coming from the very first generation of the Sony A7. I was worried whether this was worth the extra $500 versus A7M3 but after typing it out, it seems like it was. Versus the A7M3, it has...- Higher resolution photos.- More autofocus points.- Bird eye autofocus.- Better stabilization.- 4k60p vs 4k30p video.- Higher res viewfinder/LCD.- Bigger image buffer.- 5GHz WiFi support.- USB3.2 support.To each their own, but it felt like for $500 difference, that was worth it for me in the long run.Having now for about a week, I will say coming from the Sony A7 (first gen) - it's amazing on all fronts. It does feel heavier, but the bigger battery, in-body image stabilization, and other cool tech shenanigans surely have to attribute to this.Autofocus is 99% perfect; seems like in dim-light scenarios, not as great as I was hoping but it's barely off.The video looks fantastic.Love the new menu system.An amazing amount of customization. Those just beginning will definitely want to study up on YouTube for what everything does.Flip out screen is great, but I do miss the first gen's folding system a little for outdoor photography; you can of course get MORE articulation with your screen now but it just takes longer to fold out, plus it's outside of the camera body which worries me with durability in mind.The quality of the body and grip feel fine; I am tending to miss the first gen's material choices as well but I think this will grow on me.Loving the arrangement of buttons and switch choices.Performance seems stellar. I paired with dual Lexar Professional 2000x (LSD2000128G-BNNNU) and haven't had any issues.Solid thumbs up, and can't wait to use this camera for 7+ years as I did with the first-gen.",

    "text": "The a7iII is also a good choice if you need to lower the price tag.  So far the a7iv has done every thing the reviewers said it would do.  My personal advice is, ignore all those guys who tell you to do this first.  Get to know your camera and then figure out what settings work best for you.  Sony, Cannon, Nikon, Fuji, etc all make good cameras.  Unless there's really a compelling reason to switch systems, stick with the one you know..  Spend you money on good glass, rather than the latest camera.  My old Sony A99 has about taken one too many bounces.  It took me a long time to decide it was time to move to mirrorless.  I've alway thought mirrowlless for digital cameras was the way to go.  I stuck with old Sony SLT cameras because I could sue my Minolta lenses on them.  Now I'm slowly getting a new lens collection.",

    "text": "Overall I like this camera body a lot, but I feel like it wasn't as huge a jump from a7iii as that camera was up from a7ii. It is definitely worth it if you are eyeing the a7iii but don't mind spending a bit more for nice features.Good:Everything that's great about the a7iii but now with:- 10-bit video- HEVC- 4k60- +9MP- ridiculously good AF, like stupidly good- higher available bitrates when using v90 cards.- Full size HDMI port- Streaming/direct usb stream support to make it the most epic webcam ever- improved ibis with crop based stabilization on top of mechanical sensor shiftBad:- I don't like how they made the body bigger. It feels quite big compared to a7iii.- the 4k60 crop sucks, as everyone else has stated. It's fine for tight shots but if you need to do something wide you will need a lens like 12-24mm- overheats in continuous 4K recording after about an hour at room temp. Yes, I set it to high temp threshold. It does still overheat just takes longer. Had to rig up a fan system for continuous longer recording (see pic). From my extensive testing, this solves the problem, and allows for recording for hours and hours even at 4k60, but I had to come up with it myself using parts from Amazon and SmallRig. If you don't want to do all this you may have to stick to 1080p if you're recording something hours long.- My rear top dial (the one I have assigned to iris, next to the EV Comp dial) started malfunctioning about 4 months in. Currently without the body as Sony is taking care of that under warranty. Not thrilled with that but hopefully the repair will last.",

I make my daily blogs on this camera, I LOVE the auto settings because it corrects automatically to whatever lighting you need in any setting. Perfect for vlogs. I love the product showcase, instantly focusing on what I want it to focus on. The flip out screen is in a great position, I love the big record button, and the versatility of this camera. I\u2019m a huge SONY fan already and this camera made me an even bigger one. THE ONLY CON ABOUT THIS CAMERA (in my opinion) is the battery life. This thing loses battery so quickly, so just make sure to charge it frequently and check the battery before going out to film. Otherwise, it\u2019s definitely worth the money. I take it with me everywhere. It fits easily into my small purse, and it\u2019s easy to use if you\u2019re a beginner. Love this camera!",

    "text": "Sony came so close to making a great camera for vloggers and people on the move.  It combines a 1\" sensor, Zeiss lens, and a truly fantastic focus system.  Unfortunately, without some sort of active gimbal, it is nearly impossible to hold steady enough to get acceptable footage. I originally tried the handheld stick which came with the accessory pack... it was useless... even with the SteadyShot on I was unable to hold the camera still enough to eliminate shake.Notes- (please note... I am only reviewing this for its video capability)- I am going to start off with the positive.  The focus system is remarkable. I absolutely love that the camera will put itself in macro mode and focus on objects in the foreground. It is also remarkably fast in focusing in making the adjustment.  This is a very useful tool for doing vlog style product features... you can record your face and then have the camera immediately (and almost magically) focus on a product that you throw in front of it. The challenge is next point)- If you are doing this while holding the camera on some sort of non-active gimbal  - your footage will likey have some serious shake.  Personally, I find this to be a cardinal sin. YT and other services usually de-rank videos with shaky footage.-  Of course, you can overcome the shake by 1) using a tripod 2) getting an active gimbal.  Option 1 is ok... but it kinda defeats the purpose of the super-fast focus.  So I went with #2... and I was able to find a pretty decent active gimbal that worked well. Honestly, it dropped the shake to a point that I would have expected from the camera alone.- The microphone is good... but not great. It is a solid choice for vlogging since it is omnidirectional.- The picture quality is pretty good, but it's not going to blow you away.  Like most cameras, it does well in well-lit conditions (i.e sunlight) but it starts to fall short in indoor environments.  I was recently comparing footage (outdoors) between the ZV-1 and my iPhone 11 pro... the picture quality was comparable (although the iPhone has less shake).  I am not saying an iPhone is better for videoing (its not.. the ZV-1 has much, much better focusing, microphone, options, and etc).- In a somewhat unfair comparison.. I recently filmed a trip to the zoo with both the ZV-1 and my Canon HFG60 (which also has a 1\" sensor).  The Canon camcorder had a much better picture and I was able to film without the need of an active gimbal. Granted the Canon isn't designed to be used for one-handed vlogging..... but it did highlight some of the limits with the ZV-1- Form - Another thing that Sony got right. The ZV-1 is super light, can easily be held one-handed, and has a nice articulating screen. I found the buttons to be a bit awkward and a bit too recessed which caused me to accidentally *not push* record when I was trying to record something.- The Sony menu system is ok... I am not used to it... so it is bit cumbersome for me- Pro features...  This camera isn't designed for pros. I see no option for manual focus (Not that big of a deal)  but you really can't even operate it in manual mode. It has a manual mode, but you're not going to be able to change the settings on the fly.- The lens is a F1.8/2.8 so it is reasonably fast. It also allows for some decent bokeh despite a smallish sensor.Final Verdict... It kinda feels like I a being hard on the ZV-1 by giving it 3 stars.  However.... on one of my trips, I forgot to bring the connecting plate for my gimbal, and the ZV-1 became nearly worthless.  While it has some very strong features... it could have been so much more!",

    "text": "Let me start out by saying that I've used dozens of cameras over the past few years as a bit of a gear head.  I've had full frame DSLRs, full frame mirrorless, APS-C options, micro 4/3's, etc.  Most recently I had the Fuji X100V.  Having a growing family I realized that while I love taking pictures of my kids growing up, what really captures the interest of everyone is capturing videos.  I could take 1,000 pictures from a family trip and the things that the family will want to see is the video, not the pictures.  For this I realized that having a more compelling video option was needed.  In addition having a 7 year old girl, she's starting to want to make her own videos, which I post to her private YT channel.Pros- Having a compact option with a decently fast lens.  The lens could be wider, it could be longer.  There's a lot of could haves.  Why not ask for a 12-500 mm lens?  For what it is, it's a good compromise, has a decent enough range and fast lens, which is needed for a 1\" sensor.  The 24-200 would've been too slow to shoot indoors without an external light.- The front flip screen.  It makes talking head videos easier to shoot, putting it on a tripod and still having a hot/cold shoe for an external mic or a light source is fantastic.- Button layout.  Having a record button, having a tally light are great.Cons- I would've loved to see a better use of a touch screen interface.  Canon has it right for the most part, Sony could be much better.- I would've loved to have a mode dial and/or more front dials.  But given a choice between what we have in the ZV-1 or a larger body/more expensive model, I'm ok with what we have.Things to noteNo, the stabilization is not the best.  On standard it's not great.  On active it's better but crops in.  This is why I say for certain types of vlogging, like on a tripod or talking head video it's fine.  If you're expecting to walk around and talk to yourself, you'll want to invest in a gimbal.  No, the battery isn't the best.  Luckily they're tiny and you can find plenty of generic options.  No, you don't get a charger in the box.  Most cameras these days are not shipping with one.  No you won't get the ultra thin depth of field from this, it's a 1\" sensor, there are limitations.For the price, the size, the features, it's the best option that I've found at the present time.  It's not perfect, but any camera enthusiast will tell you that there isn't.  It's about weighing the positives and the negatives and find the one with the most plusses and the least amount of negatives for your needs.  Think about it, if the perfect camera existed, you'd have no compelling reason to upgrade to the next model, so in a way you have to think that manufacturers intentionally withhold a little here and a little there.",

    "text": "This camera takes nice pictures, and is everything the various reviewers on the internet say (good pictures, videos, etc).For me, it was not what I wanted. The buttons and knobs are way too small, and my fingers are way too big to manipulate the thing. It is a very small camera, and is so light that it feels like a toy. On a tripod, it won't shake, but in my hands it has no heft at all and shakes too much.The menu system is tedious, especially with the tiny buttons. But the good part is that there is a huge amount of help available on the net, due to the popularity of the camera.I bought an aftermarket grip and it is a lifesaver. Made by Aodelan.  It helps with adding a little mass to the whole thing, and if you get this camera get the grip, without a doubt.You need to be careful using this thing. The lens extends about an inch and a half when engaged, and if you accidently have the camera facing down, the motor will try and push the lens out and make the camera do a pushup. I am sure this will damage the lens motor, so watch out!The picture quality is a little better than my cell phone. It can take pictures in moderate lighting, but it gets grainy.I mostly use cameras for tracking myself dancing tango with a partner, and for food photography. I have a Samsung NX10, which became obsolete. And I have a Canon G7. I am not sure that this Sony camera is any better than my old G7. But it is more modern.I think I would have been better off spending the money on lighting and continue using the G7. But the Sony camera is a good product, if you can deal with the tiny controls.Realistically, a good cell phone is about the same as this camera. I think the next step up from a good cell phone is probably a full frame camera with a good lens.",

    "text": "I was excited to have received the ZV-1 Sony Vlog Camera. I saved the first use for the day I went hiking on a trail. This is my experience: Setup was extremely easy after charging the camera up! Battery and sd card goes in the same access port. Wind screen and the bluetooth remote tripod can easily attach to camera.The bluetooth remote tripod accessory is worth praising in itself. Easy to maneuver, you can swivel it a full 360\u00b0 and tilt it forward and backwards to a max 90\u00b0 which is more than enough. Using the tripod, you can zoom in/out, record and take a photo. Conveniently enough, it has a provided lock function to prevent accidental touch. When attached to the ZV-1, with a grip weight of 7.6 oz., you don't feel the stress on your hand and arms even after carrying it for 2 hours during my hike.There are some great functions to the ZV-1 that one looks for in their vlogging experience. You have the LCD screen which allows you to see what you are recording which I can tell you is necessary. Another feature I find necessary is the soft screen effect. Especially since you're filming in 4K mode, you have to look good for the camera. My skin isn't perfect and this feature helps me not shy away from placing the camera too close to my face. Oh; and speaking of \"close\", we need to talk about the \"Product Showcase\" aspect of the ZV-1. This means the ability to focus on what the camera owner is trying to show its viewers. It is superb in this camera as it quickly focuses on the item I place closest to the lens in front of me. I tested this in the outdoors where there are many distractions in the background and it performed really well. This function will work great in product reviews. There are a lot of other functions, modes and setting one can adjust for their preference but as someone who has been mostly using a phone, it can be a bit complicated to understand. Luckily, it has an auto-intelligence mode that will adjust the picture/recording settings for you so you don't have to fret. I will learn to understand the technicalities as I go on.Another note to takeaway from my experience is about the battery life. After a full charge and being periodically used for picture taking and recording during my 2-3 hours I spent outdoors, the battery was already drained. I recommend having backup batteries for that matter. While my phone can do many things the ZV-1 can, there's also things only the ZV-1 can do. I'll be switching to the ZV-1 for my vlogging needs!",

    "text": "Update:  So, after 6 mos of back & forth with the supplier, the repair people they referred me to & Sony themselves, I am very happy to report that SONY came thru for us. They had my daughter send the camera back to them, had their people check it out & decided it was just a one off - would cost more to fix it than replace it. We received a brand new camera, same model & they even sent back the SIM card & new battery I bought trying to fix it myself. Perseverance paid off & the customer service rep we dealt with was wonderful. Thank you, SONY, for standing behind your products. I will continue to be a customer.I bought this camera for my daughter - she does a lot on social media as part of her job. She was super excited about this model. Fast forward 9 months - the camera just stops working - won\u2019t even turn on! Called support & was told it was probably the battery. Really? It\u2019s less than a year old! Didn\u2019t offer to send a new battery so I bought one. Camera turns on, works for approximately 5 minutes & shuts off again. Phone calls & emails go back & forth until what? You guessed it - \u201coh it\u2019s out of warranty.\u201d You gotta be kidding!!!\ud83d\ude21 No one can tell me what\u2019s actually wrong with the camera but a 3rd party service/repair shop quoted me almost $500 to fix it. Hello? That\u2019s almost as much as the camera itself! NOT HAPPY!! Do NOT purchase this model from the vendor! Extremely dissatisfied customer here.",

    "text": "This camera was getting tons of great reviews on Youtube....I was Between this and the Cannon M50.  All the reviews I saw spoke highly of the mic...most certainly the onboard mic is not \"shotgun mic\" quality. Upon first use I knew I couldn't use the onboard mic, brings to mind a song lyric \"oh..am I sitting in a tin can, far above the world\" The mic was one of the appeals of this lightweight point and shoot vlogger friendly camera. Image stabilization is probably a 7 out of 10. Sony video quality goes without saying.  So all and all a good vlogging/point and shoot camera. Plan to get an external mic...but a small inexpensive shotgun mic will get the job done. I use Comica CVM Compact.Battery life is a real issue here..so I bought the optional bluetooth mini tripod and I used this for filming and vlogging, don't expect much over 25 mins out of a battery if you're filming...and the battery door/SD card door cannot be opened from the side...so you have to remove the tripod or quick mount every time you change to a new battery or remove/install full size SD card.  This is simply a hassle for the user.  I'm replacing my Sony AX33...for now I'd rather have the heavy video camera with longer battery life and better image stabilization.  All and all it's still a good point and shoot...just lacks in the engineering for easy removal of battery and SD card.  Nobody wants to plug in their camera to charge it....especially if it won't last 30 mins during video use. You need to buy additional batteries and a charger...but they're pretty inexpensive.  I'd buy it over a Cannon 80D any day of the week if that tells ya anything.Overall it's light, very easy to use, great picture and video quality, decent image stabilization once you learn the camera, battery life is lacking and the mic might be ok for an entry level vlogger....always remember..viewers will forgive bad video...but bad audio will not be tolerated and your watch time will show it.Hope this helps you in your purchase decision. I will buy again if this one gets damaged. It's as light as a feather!",

Great platform to start with and/or learn on as it's quite malleable / provides a lot of options for shooting as well. Highly recommended.",

    "text": "At first I paired this up with a Camlink 4k for streaming and was frustrated by the washed-out look in OBS. I realized that this camera requires a lot of configuration both in any desktop software using it, as well as in the camera's deep-dive menu system.After you get everything dialed in, it is simply amazing. This is not a pick up and go camera. This is a complex tool that requires a bit of configuration to get right. But once you do, it will blow you away.I did notice the rolling shutter problem, but I'm not using this for fast panning or action.The stock lens is impressive, and can only get better as you customize with better Sony, Sigma, or other specialty lenses. I like that the bundle lens is 16-50mm so if you're new to the APS-C format you can easily figure out what your favorite focal lengths are and upgrade to better lenses in that range. Not that you'll have to upgrade, the bundled lens can meet all your needs easily. Overall package is very light and small.USB-C power needs to provide at least 2A in order to keep the camera running a long time for a stream. Otherwise the battery drains pretty quickly (around 2 hours max).I am very happy with this camera, get it if you're thinking about it.",

    "text": "I bought this as a HUGE upgrade to the macbook webcam for Zoom calls. The difference in image quality with just the kit lens is worth the price. I do finding myself wanting a different lens for more bokeh. The background defocus feature doesn't really work. I use it with a Sennheiser MKE 400 mic (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08YS34YRS), which does an amazing job. Together, this is like going from a 1980s 13-inch TV to modern 4k and SONOS. I had no idea how terrible the macbook webcam really is.That said, the user experience is severely lacking.0. This is literally made for vlogging, but it doesn't come with a USB cable and it doesn't come with an a/c adapter. The a/c adapter from Sony is $100. That's insane. You'd think it would work with just USB connected, but ports with power delivery are at a premium on my hub and the battery dies when plugged into a port without power delivery. Until I find a better solution or break down and buy the a/c adapter, it's plugged into my macbook, which creates unnecessary clutter. No like.1. The a/c adapter uses the battery port, so the most expensive a/c adapter I've ever heard of can't charge a battery. The only way you can charge a battery with this kit is inside the camera. The Sony battery charger, should you need one, is another $100 dollars. This thing stays mounted above and behind a monitor. I don't need one.2. A standard USB cable sticks out the side of the camera and will block the camera display when it is folded out. Annoying. I get around this by using a cable with a right-angle connector. That makes it hard to remove and reinsert, which I wouldn't care about, but...3. You have to disconnect and reconnect the usb cable to enable streaming after turning the camera off and back on. This is an entirely unnecessary engineering fail. I like to have my setup dialed in with good cable management. I don't appreciate the wear and tear on the cables and connectors. I'm confident this could be fixed with a firmware update, but I'm not holding my breath.4. Every time you turn it on, you have to go back through the same menus to select usb streaming. It seems to go to a random place in the menus. This has to be done before connecting the USB cable. So instead of just turning on my computer in the morning, I turn on my computer, turn on my camera, disconnect the USB cable, fish through the menus with 4 to 10 clicks on the camera controls, and reconnect the usb cable.",

    "text": "Trust me, I would have stayed with Canon FOREVER but I was tired of the subpar 4k video on equally-priced Sony cameras so I had to switch. This Sony camera is AMAZING and I feel silly for not switching sooner!I AM NOT A PROFESSIONAL PHOTOGRAPHER OR VIDEOGRAPHER, just a female who likes high-quality gear. I will compare it to the Canon Cameras I have returned/sold, rebought and still own (which are all the Canon Rebel Series, Canon 70/80d, Canon EOS 6D Mark II, and Canon M50). These are JUST the highlights of comparison to the Canon Cameras I own with my 9-month experience using this Sony camera.4k VIDEO DIFFERENCES over Canon (all Rebels, 70D, 80d, 6D Mark II, M50)* Actual 4k pixeled file, smooth and crisp.* Doesn't have image stabilizer, but can fix in FCPX. Need a tripod or gimbal for moving videos.* Smaller 4k files than any Canon camera I own, faster upload/download and editing time* No record time limit* 6k sampling* Processes video files MUCH fasterBATTERY LIFE DIFFERENCES over Canon (all Rebels, 70D, 80d, 6D Mark II, M50)* Similar to 80d/Mark II* Option to plug the battery directly into the wall for continuous power. Need to buy this plug separately.* Can charge camera as you use it tooAUTO-FOCUS DIFFERENCES over Canon (all Rebels, 70D, 80d, 6D Mark II, M50)* Faster autofocus but not perfect for video (still quicker than Canon)* Super fast autofocus for imagesSOUND QUALITY DIFFERENCES over Canon (all Rebels, 70D, 80d, 6D Mark II, M50)* Useable audio, much better than Canon PERIOD. (still would use external mic but a great back-up audio option)Obviously, there is A LOT more great features than this but these were the most important ones for me (coming from Canon). The camera does not have any heating issues, haven't had it shut off on me yet in 9 months of using it. I didn't have an issue with the shoe being on top, as I hardly used a gimbal (some didn't like that). Also, the colors are nice, perfect for my skin tone (not too blue) and I prefer it over the Canon. I know I probably may change my mind as Canon releases its newer models but for now, I'm very pleased with this Sony. GO SONY!!!!!!! I hope this somewhat helps you :)",

    "text": "Exceptional camera. Menu system not as bad as reviews said. Does not get hot at all after a 2.5hr non-stop video at 1080p using dummy battery. Does get quite warm, in a 72deg room, when recording at 4k, but not hot. Internal mics are mediocre, but added shotgun mic and audio is excellent. This is the water-resistant AL-magnesium version, a step up from a6100; worth added expense for magnesium housing and water resistance for protection on a rainy day. Bought with 19-135 lens, pics are excellent.  Only flaw is why the camera cannot output h.264 video over USB or the WiFi? Instead have to buy a hokey (price gouged) HDMI \"capture\" card; HDMI is already digital. Sony has h.264 compression in the a6400. It is used on videos recorded to the SD card. The new a7 will have h.265 lossless compression; too bad they were not on the ball and did not put this in the a6400.  h.264 compression is several years old!UPDATE: After a year and a half, all I can say is fantastic! I am nearsighted and the red focus assist negates the need to wear glasses or use the viewfinder's built-in diopter adjuster. I use this cam with a Laowa 9mm rectilinear lens (manual focus) for indoor pics, and the articulated screen is great for this. It allows the camera to work like a Hassalblad; holding the camera low to get the angle right (so vertical lines are parallel). One can hold the camera at waist height and tilt the screen up. With the 35-135 kit zoom, the auto-focus is excellent. With the SEL200600G, works great, but the big zoom does use up the battery, so keep a spare. Another wow factor is the digital-zoom-in-while-focusing (C1 button in still pic mode). This allows viewing the image zoomed in to get the focus perfect. Water rest mag case is the way to go too. I never worry about being out in the rain with this camera (but I do make an effort to not let it get wet anyway to be safe). probably have shot several THOUSAND pics and all I can say is \"wish I had this camera thirty years ago\". Thanks Sony!",

Obviously it's not full frame, so there is a slight compromise in the look/depth of images, but in general this camera produces amazing results. It's actually better in low light than the 5d Mark ii (which is now a few generations old). My only two qualms are: 1.) Lack is in-body IS. It's pretty difficult to take steady video without a gimbal or tripod, and 2.) Poor battery life. I highly recommend buying multiple batteries, and always having a backup charged! Overall, I'd HIGHLY recommend this camera!",

    "text": "The electronic view finder is complete garbage. I you intend to use it to save battery life or compose shots look elsewhere, and only buy this if you intend to chimp over the larger screen all the time. The Cannon M6 Mark ii, Sony A6400, or Fujifilm XT-30 all have better viewfinders for a very small price difference. The auto-focus is amazing and if you are just a casual user who will stick with the kit lens this is a good deal. But the auto-focus on most modern cameras are very good as well and I've rarely had to complain about them. Sony has committed themselves much more to their full frame offerings than the APS-C format. Its true that Sigma and others have tried to step in to fill the gaps in Sony's line up, but you have to ask yourself if this company doesn't have a complete line up of lenses for APS-C how do they treat the APS-C cameras for firmware updates, software updates, and camera bodies? Their priority is clearly with full frame. Remember you're buying into a system of lenses as the camera body is meant to be updated as technology advances. If you have ten Sony lenses you'll have a strong incentive to stay with their products so do yourself a favor and make certain the company you choose has a track record of continuous improvement and development. I got this as a gift from a well meaning relative, and to be honest I prefer Sony's color science in JPEG. That said I wont be keeping it because I can't live with the EVF. I recommend you look for what you need and want in a camera and then do your homework as to which system will meet that need best. I'm primarily a stills shooter and image quality is my priority. Because of this I'll be going over to Fuji because I believe the XT-30 will better meet the needs I have with a huge line of affordable quality lenses and the XF18-55 kit lens is the absolute best on the market. If you are primarily a video shooter and can live with the limitations of the A6100's viewfinder this may be a good deal for you. But if you plan to stay with Sony for a small price you can update to the A6400 get a metal body, a much better EVF, and a few other perks. With all that said this is a good camera. It takes great shots out of the camera with little to no input from the user. The menus are a little convoluted but adapting isn't that difficult once you get the hang of it. Low light shooting is ok with minimal artifacts and noise. The A6100 at the time of this review is about ~$750 which means it technically isn't trying to compete with the other cameras I mentioned above. Some of its direct competitors are the Fuji X-A7 and Cannon m200 neither of which offer a viewfinder, so in fairness I can't dock it star for having a crap viewfinder and while I would like to knock one off for the lens situation it wouldn't do this camera justice.  For a price sensitive buyer this is a great deal and easily 5 stars. With a little more cash and a desire to stick with the Sony system the A6400 or A6600 make a better value proposition.",

    "text": "I've had this camera all of 3 days and so far, there is a LOT to like about it. I got the a6100 with the 16-50 kit lens, and also picked up the Sigma 30/f1.4 lens.I have a lot to learn, but so far, I am impressed with the number of features and customization options available. I decided on this model for a few reasons:- Fit it my budget (barely)- Excellent autofocus system- External mic port- Battery can charge inside the camera, so I can use external battery packs as needed- Very manageable size- Since the Alpha line is so popular, there's tons of online tutorials and guides for using this camera- Bluetooth and WiFi connectivitySo, why only 4 stars? In short, the Imaging Edge Mobile app for the iPhone is incredibly frustrating. Sony makes great hardware, but they fall flat on their face when it comes to creating usable software and apps. Imaging Edge Mobile is a text book example of Sony's inability to consider user experience when designing an app. Clearly, this was made by hardware engineers and not UI/UX designers. Which would be acceptable, if the app actually worked as intended. The setup for WiFi to transfer photos is really confusing and poorly documented, but at least that works. The Bluetooth connection for geo-tagging photos (using my iPhone XR as the source of location information) is a complete failure. I can pair the a6100 camera to my phone once, and it works for a while, but the next time I use my camera, the app loses the Bluetooth connection and can't reconnect. No amount of playing with settings in the app or camera seem to help. My only option is to uninstall the app, re-install the app and set it up again from the beginning. And now I need to find a new way to geo-tag my photos because the Sony Imaging Edge Mobile app has failed at its job.As a result, the very first review of the a6100 on Amazon is a bit of a negative review. In my opinion, this is a 5-star camera with a 1-star mobile app. If geo-tagging and mobile apps are not a priority for you, you're in for a treat with this camera. But, if you want to geo-tag your photos, you'll need to find another option.",

    "text": "I'm by no means a professional photographer, I've always been interested in it, and have always wanted a digital camera to get to that next level after smart phone photography. The A6100 is a great entry into that space. You can start off by using it like a point and shoot, and as you learn more about the manual controls, you can use the camera in a way that gives you practice for something even better.I've only been using the kit lens so far, and will note that it is somewhat fragile. One small 1 ft drop, caused the auto-zoom to make a grinding sound. While still fully functional, it does make me a bit nervous using it.The digital viewfinder works well in bright conditions, the larger screen is a bit hard to see in daylight. Also, the menu system is a little painful to navigate, but luckily it lets you favorite certain settings to be accessible easier.While the photo quality is good with the kit lens, the video quality is absolutely superior to what I can shoot with an iPhone 11 Pro. I'm looking forward to trying out different lenses, and can absolutely recommend this camera to someone who is interested in taking the next step to further their photography hobby. Not sure how it stacks up against other cameras!Oh also, the AI-assisted autofocus works great for people and pets alike.",

    "text": "Soy principiante en la fotograf\u00eda y al final me decid\u00ed por comprarme esta camara. Estoy muy contenta con la compra. Decid\u00ed pedirla por Amazon por la garant\u00eda de devoluci\u00f3n.Las fotograf\u00edas nocturnas que he hecho con el objetivo kit 16-50mm son espectaculares, y las diurnas no se quedan atr\u00e1s. Ni que en general los men\u00fas de Sony son criticados, yo encuentro que es f\u00e1cil navegar por ellos (aunque muy recomendable hacerte tu propio men\u00fa de favoritos). La cantidad de fotografias por segundo utilizando el modo r\u00e1faga es extraordinaria. La c\u00e1mara tiene otras caracter\u00edsticas que me gustan mucho como el reconocimiento facial (para el enfoque) o el enfoque detectando los ojos. La camara da muchas opciones y es muy vers\u00e1til. Otra cosa que me encanta es que el cuerpo de la c\u00e1mara es muy ligero.Las \u00fanicas dos cosas b\u00e1sicas que creo que se podr\u00edan mejorar en \u00e9sta camara (en comparacion a las Nikon, porque no tengo experiencia con ninguna otra marca) estan relacionadas con la pantalla. La primera es que la pantalla no es abatible hacia un lado, y la segunda es que Sony no saca m\u00e1s partido al hecho de que la pantalla sea t\u00e1ctil (s\u00f3lo sirve para enfocar, pero no para navegar por men\u00fas o elegir opciones). Igualmente, que hayan hecho la pantalla abatible por si te quieres hacer selfies o por si la utilizas para hacer videos de blogger no est\u00e1 mal.En general, recomiendo la compra de \u00e9sta c\u00e1mara.",

    "text": "I was looking for a good travel camera and this one was highly recommended. Unfortunately, I found that the rolling shutter made all of my footage from running around have a jello effect. Worst of all, I\u2019m not sure if I had a bad unit, or if these vary by unit, but this camera would overheat after just 27 continuous minutes of recording video, in a cooled down room, and in about 15 continuous minutes of recording video outside in the heat. This may not be an issue for recording small clips, as it does last longer and cool down in between recordings, but it was a deal breaker for me.It\u2019s a shame because aside from these two issues, this is the perfect camera. For travel, I sacrificed the video sharpness and battery life to go with the Canon M6 mark ii, which can record continuously outside for almost 2 hours without any overheating, and has significantly better rolling shutter performance. If you invest in a stabilizer and shoot small clips at a time, then this Sony could work for you. I gave it four stars because the quality is unmatched at this price point.",

I recommend skipping on the kit lenses and jumping strait for a higher end lens, but I'm impressed by the quality of photos off such a well-priced camera.

    "text": "About me. Photography was a serious hobby back in the film days. I had the usual SLRs plus one I had modified for close up work on large format film. I also have an interest in technical illustrations. With digital I went through three low end point and shoots holding off until there was a digital that could do more than I had done with film cameras. This is that camera -- and just as I got used to no viewfinder I have one again.I first tried to focus this review as between low and high end point and shoots. But low end does not mean fewer features as it did in the film days. Today's low end was yesterday's high end. I found a theme that I think works. This camera takes even old, expected features and expands their limits while perfecting them. At the same time it includes features which simplify doing what the experts do.That said, I am enthusiastic about this camera. The single disappointment is it does not stitch the interval photos into a time lapse movie clip. But I can do that with free software on my computer so it is not a serious disappointment.I have tried a little bit to keep my perverse sense of humor under control. I did not completely succeed.On with the review.===The price is not for one gimmick like the zoom range which is what gets your first attention. Every feature is state of the art. If you want to save $100 you will take a hit in several areas. Sure you really can survive with a lesser zoom range but that camera will have other lesser features such as 720p max instead of 1080p. This is a well-engineered camera. You don't take a hit on one feature to get another. It does not have one great feature on an otherwise mediocre camera. If you are considering buying you can stop trying to find the \"gotchas.\" There are none.Yes it does have a point and shoot size sensor. The size and cost of the lens is a function of the sensor size. The larger the sensor the more the camera will cost for the same lens features. The good news is the sensor is CMOS instead of CCD. This gives the same performance in lower light so the lower f-stop of the lens is less of a handicap. Related to this the low f-stop is related to the zoom range for the same price range.Guys! It comes in the same shade of red as that sports car you are going to buy some day. Don't dismiss it as girlie.In the auto mode it is an idiot proof point and shoot. You don't have to read the fine manual. Turn it on, pop up the flash and press the shutter button. Wife, son, daughter, relative or in-law can take a picture of you with no instructions whatsoever. No more family outings with dozens of pictures of everyone but you. You do not have to carry a simple point and shoot in addition to this camera.And by idiot proof I mean myself. When in doubt get at least one image in the auto mode before playing around. It is likely to be near the best shot you can get. Trust the camera. The software has all the technical knowledge as well photographic judgement included.Technical because snow scenes really are bluish as the snow reflects the blue sky so that it technically correct. Photographic judgement because our eyes adjust to snow when out in it and do not see the blue. But it shows up in prints where it shows the real scene not what we saw. So the snow mode takes out the blue. In fireworks we \"see\" lots of after images that really are not there so the camera makes exposure compensations to produce the image we saw not what was actually there at the time of the exposure. Trust the camera. It knows the tricks of the trade.Yes that 36x zoom got your attention. You might have missed the 1cm, 4/10\", close up macro while thinking about taking pictures of the moon. It means a close-up of a quarter won't fit on a monitor. So you get a low power microscope thrown into the deal. If you can get insects to hold still more power to you. Flowers can't fly away.Those pictures of a huge rising full moon are done by taking a picture of it at full zoom so it appears much larger compared to objects on the horizon. Do not try this with the sun unless you can comfortably look at it without sunglasses. It can destroy the sensor. You can also do these with interval timing to show the rise and set of the sun. When you can do what the pro's do you have bragging rights.The 22.5mm with no zoom is wide enough to take a group photo in a small room and gives a good chunk of the landscape without using the panorama mode. The zoom range allows you to take pictures at any distance with subject filling the frame. A zoom lens to do this with a DSLR will cost several times more than this camera if you can find one. Generally you will need several lenses and a 2nd mortgage to pay for them.Yes it is large and weighs a pound. Weight is good because there is less vibration. Size is good because five finger, two-handed grip means less vibration. Besides that the vibration reduction schemes work quite well. Nothing will substitute for a good tripod or for resting against something solid even your own chest with the extended LCD. Nothing will substitute for a steady mount in low light. This is state of the art engineering not magic.Putting stabilization and higher zoom levels together means you can get pictures of action without having to get close enough to disturb the action. The kids have discovered a new bug or something. You can get pictures of it without getting so close that you get \"Daddy, look what we found\" changing the scene you wanted.The other side of the coin is you can be part of the fun using the auto mode without having to think about the camera. Click the flower icon and get a picture of what the kids found so interesting -- maybe it isn't something dead. (And if it is dead you can hide the image from the review menu so mother doesn't see it.) No fumbling with settings and menus. No \"hold still while I get the camera ready\" or \"You're blocking the light.\" The camera will take care of you.Want to have a little fun? Put it in smart portrait mode and point it at a TV and watch it finding the faces. This also gives a feel for how it identifies faces so you can learn how focus will work when shooting people. BTW: This takes processing which means it is a battery drain. If other modes do similar amounts of processing this explains why the battery does not last as long as people seem to expect.Why care? The batteries are cheap enough. I got a charger and three spares for about $10. I have not made note of conditions such as flash/no flash but I haven't gotten less than 120 shots per charge and as high as 250. Outside the camera they take about a hour to recharge. I'm not complaining about battery life in the least. While your at it a spare SD card never hurts. An extra $25 in functional extras for a $400 camera is peanuts.An 8GB card is over a thousand images at the largest size and highest quality. Unless you want to carry around the family photo album that is big enough for most uses. 8GB is also around five fully charged batteries worth of pictures. If you are not going to carry the spare batteries there is no point to a larger card.If you do not want to read the manual just put it in auto and forget it. You can figure out what all the commonly used settings do just by pushing the buttons.The manual on disk is concise. It does cover every feature but you have to read carefully. Each subsection is telling you something. There is a high dynamic range (HDR) mode buried in the camera. One line will tell you the 1cm close up is only at the third step of the zoom. It is all there.Every feature is covered with a short explanation of what it does. It is enough to try it and see for yourself. Yes, each section could be longer but it is not an education in photography.If you want to learn digital photography there are books devoted to that. Here is a secret those publishers do not want you to know. 90% of what the books are telling you is the same for both film and digital. What you can find in a used book store is most of what you need and with luck for 10% of the price. If you don't mind doing your own research you can google up all you need to know for free.And if you have had digital cameras before everything you learned on the low end cameras translates to this camera. The basic buttons are even in the same place and do the same things. What more can you ask?===Yes, autofocus is slow in low lighting conditions. Autofocus works by maximizing contrast. In low light there is little contrast. The red LED is trying to brighten the image enough produce contrast. There are limits to what technology can do. That is why there is manual focus -- use it. Keep in mind if it were not for the capabilities of this camera you would likely not be trying some of these low light pictures. Something is better than nothing.Which leads to what this camera is beyond point and shoot. It lets you get beyond the point and shoot when the scene modes are not good enough or simply do not get what you want. Sure we can talk about being artistic but are we really artists? Will the next Ansel Adams please raise his hand? We are looking for the best picture or for something interesting that cannot be easily added by computer software such as Gimp dot org -- which google as it is free.Lets go back a few decades when automated exposure was the latest must have feature in cameras. Before that it was all manual. After the automatic exposure fad wore off the companies introduced aperture and shutter priority modes. Progress and then lets get back to the good old days. So this camera has the four modes one expects cameras to have as options in addition to the full auto, idiot proof mode. But even in these modes the camera tries to warn you if try to do something the software says should not work but it doesn't stop you from trying.So what has changed? Auto not only sets the proper exposure. It tries to pick the right scene mode. You can choose the scene mode manually or you can trust the camera. Most of the time it is going to work as well as you picking the scene. There are so many scene modes to choose from I doubt anyone can pretend to have tried them all. Here in Tampa, Florida snow scenes are out. For the scenes I have tried there is no quality difference between my choice and auto. They are different but best is a matter of taste.But you do want to try several options. A night portrait in muted incandescent porch light is different from a camp fire which is not a candle. Now think of a night portrait of a subject with a camp fire in the background. There is only so much the software can do. Better than adequate pictures are found in a batch of adequate pictures. Take LOTS of pictures. The camera has features like exposure bracketing to do this all at once instead of asking your subject to hold still for minutes at a time and changing the mood of a very enjoyable evening.When professional photographers say takes lots of pictures they are not just pushing the shutter a lot of times. They are changing things for each picture. One of the things they are doing is exposure bracketing. There is an automatic feature to do that. The camera has other multiple exposure features to do the other things the professionals try.I can't think of a reason for a five hour limitation for interval shooting, aka time lapse. That said, five hours will cover most events such as opening flowers. And there is no reason not put push the shutter again for another five hours worth of images. It is not a deal-breaker. It is an added feature. Unless I have missed a menu option some place this does not stitch them together into a video clip. You will need other software for that. There are image sizes compatible with video aspect ratios.True there is no way to attach filters to the lens. These days there isn't much use for them save to protect the lens as image processing software can do all the effects and dozens more. The only reason left is to protect the lens. This is a glass lens. It is not easy to scratch. I do not worry about it. I have used cameras regularly for over 40 years and have never scratched a lens. If I were to worry about something it would be dust in the zoom mechanism, flour in the kitchen being in the category of dust. That is just a guess. I have no idea if that would be a problem. Given this is from Nikon I doubt it.===Despite another review, the camera I have does in fact have zoom in one power steps. It isn't smooth but it isn't big jumps either. And yes it is a bit slow but if it were faster it would be harder to adjust. It takes a bit of practice to get fine control of the zoom. If it were faster fine adjustment would be harder. Until there is a multi-speed zoom, you can't have it both ways.A faster zoom would also be a noisier zoom and people love to zoom while making movies. They either do not like the noise of the zoom or complain the sound goes off while zooming. One wishes people would notice how rarely zoom is used by Hollywood. It is rarely used because it rarely works for a scene. Don't do it.Making movies is a different set of skills than stills. It is better to splice a long and a close shot than to zoom in. It has more dramatic effect. Zooms that do work are so fast they might as well be splices.Remember you are not making a movie. For movies you are supposed to splice scenes together, change their order, delete scenes. Unless you are doing post production editing you are not making a movie, you are recording an event, warts and all. The bride might want to have the entire ceremony start to finish to relive it at some indeterminate future date. No one else ever wants to see in its entirety not even, or perhaps especially not, the groom.Keep in mind this is a fancy still camera with movie capability included. If you want to make serious movies you need to get a video camera as much above a Flip\u00ae as this is above a simple point and shoot. Videos need much greater stabilization than stills. Tripods are a necessity. When the camera moves a steady cam mount is needed. Never compare your results with those of Hollywood.Be gentle with yourself.Your standard for comparison is your neighbor's videos not what you see on TV. Do not expect miracles from the audio. Cardioid mikes pointing forward do not fit in this form factor. Professionals do not have microphones on the cameras. That is for amateur movie makers working alone. The closest professional comparison is your local evening news with $6000 and up video cameras.Keep in mind it is an added feature just as many video cameras throw in taking stills as a feature. You would not buy a movie camera for its quality stills nor vice versa.All that said, the videos aren't half bad at all. 1080p, the best HDTV standard, is as good as you have to get and it gives you the smaller formats down to old style TV, 640x480. The file size/recording time specs suggest the finest recording level is about the quality that is used for movies on DVD. It is still going to be video quality not film converted to video. It is more than good enough for family events.If you grew up on and have bad memories of home movies in Super 8, this is a whole new world. If you don't want to lug around a video camera on the off chance of a couple minutes use this will work. If you go back to the good old days of DAT tape this is still a whole new world.Above all, do not forget you can take videos. Use it for any kind of action. You may trash it later but it might be pure gold. You never know what people are going to do when they are having fun. The button is placed conveniently where you don't have to think to start recording.I find it surprising that people will take dozens of pictures of their kids at action events like little league or soccer and not have one video clip. There is software that will let you pull stills out of a movie clip. Far from the best but more than good enough for the internet.A word of advice. Do not try video of action at extreme zoom. You can't follow the action like the highly paid professionals for major league games. They practice more hours every day than you spend at a game once a week. And the networks have more than one cameramen trying to get the same action. It is not uncommon for all three cameramen to fail to get a close up. If you succeed, congratulations. If you fail, don't kick yourself, practice -- a lot.",

    "text": "First off I am not a professional photographer and I used this camera for taking photos of our kids. We had very high hopes but it just didn't work. I would say that 50% of the photos were blurry and that was not due to user error. The camera would get stuck in focus land where it just could not focus. We thought it was us until we set up our daughters doll across the living room (20x13) to be photographed. Needless to say it was our best attempt at being fair to the camera since the doll was not going to move around like the kids do and we did stand still and take the shot because even though we could have used a tripod lets face it... how often would we use one to take photos of our kids... we wanted to be fair to real life yet give the camera alittle edge with a still object to capture. We took the shot with flash on, then flash off, in auto, in portrait, and in our manual mode. We took several photos in each of the above settings and at least one out of each set was blurry. This was giving the camera an advantage and it still failed! So we are sending it back. Here is a breakdown of the good and bad.The Good:1. It zooms in and out while recording a video. Our 1 year old Panasonic did not and we hated that.2. The red color is beautiful... my favorite color on the camera by far.3. The size is just right - not too small but not overbearing to put in my purse or wear with the included carry straps.4. It is very light compared to how sturdy if feels. I held it up for long periods of time learning to use it and never felt my arms tire or lag from the weight.5. This camera feels very sturdy. I never dropped it or anything but it feels like it could take a drop and keep on shooting.6. The finger/hand grips are perfect and leave your hand feeling natural while holding it and getting the perfect shot.7. The flash it really really good. I shot many photos of different object in my bedroom by only the light from the TV and NO flash and every object came out in the photo. I also took photos of the kids and such in dark rooms and they came out clearly.. although I did not try it at a far distance. I think they were always within 10 feet of the camera when I took the photo.8. The zoom is incredible. I zoomed almost feet to a screw in the wall and it came out clearly and the details were not blurred. It is harder to hold steady zooming that far, but a steady hand and added patience and you will not be disappointed.9. All the buttons are perfectly placed and easy to navigate quickly when needing to get a shot/video10. The videos are great clarity and the sound is great. I love that the speaker is in front of the camera unlike our Panasonic that had it near the back and anytime we spoke it would end up like we were screaming since the sound on the tv had to be turned way up to hear the kids talking.11. Love the one touch button to record videos.The Bad:1. On average with shooting our three kids (that move about while we try to get the shot) we had to delete about 40% of the photos due to blurry shots no matter the mode, no matter the flash, no matter the settings.2. The auto portrait option was horrible...it took forever to get the shot and never had one that came out clear. I mean forever to get it too!3. There were times we would try to get a photo and the camera would just try and try to focus and just wouldn't. We would have to turn if off and then back on. Don't know what that was about... this occurred only twice when we turned on the camera not during taking shots.4. Why only 12.1 mp?5. No external battery charger. This is a huge oversight on Nikon's part in my opinion. I have never had a camera that didn't offer this. You can buy one here on Amazon for under 10.00 which I did but really... no sense as to why Nikon didn't just include it.6. If you try turn the camera on and the lens is in place it it will after about 10 seconds flash a notice on the LCD to \"please remove cover and then restart camera.\" Mine camera does not make all kinds of loud or grinding sounds like others have said but why not just say... remove lens cover, why do we have to turn camera off and then on again.7. One of my BIG complains is that you cannot review your photos without taking the lens over off and turing on the camera. Why can't you just leave the cover on and push another button to just view your photos or show your photos. It is also annoying to do this because if you or whomever is looking at your photos hits the pan/shoot button by accident it automatically goes into camera mode. ANNOYING!8. Auto mode was just not right for us. Over half of our photos came out blurry in auto mode, we eventually just made our own auto mode in manual and it was way more successful in getting some clear shots.Well I hope I helped someone. I hope if you get this camera it is great for you... I really wish it could have been for us.",

    "text": "Additional thoughts after 10 daysI've had some time with this camera which makes it even more willing for me to endorse it.  The wide angle works great, almost a panorama in itself.  Just 4 days ago couldn't resist getting a D5100 DSLR for Nikon, and my opinion still stands that's it's 90% of the picture quality at one third the price, even considering that an extra lens for the D5100 will get you nowhere near the zoom capabilities of the P500.Please remember this is the top end of point-and-shoot catagories, the camera is NOT a pocket, you need a small dslr case for it, but it's still lightweight enough that it won't be a nuisance to carry around. And, it has so many setting combinations that the more you experiment, the better your results will be.  The P500 has excellent out-of-camera pictures.  This has always been a complaint from me on point-and-shoots, that you almost always needed post-processing to get the exposure right. Here you do not.One final compliment: This would be the camera, if I could only take one, that I would take to a Yankees game. I would switch it to movie and take a film of a walk-off to put on YouTube!And finally, if you have a P-series Nikon like I do, it is a worthwhile upgrade.Best Nikon Point-and-shoot-If you have one and want to upgrade, this is it!  For three years I've had a Coolpix P80, and more than being impressed, almost overwhelmed with it, I'm always checking for the latest evolution, and the current straight-line P120 didn't make me want to make a jump.  Didn't know that a P500 even existed until I started browsing. To me the series \"L\" Nikons were the popular priced Nikon point-and-shoots (ala L22,etc and L110s)so this camera had the specs to make me interested and buy.Here';s what I love about it so far, and why I bought it: WIDE ANGLE 22.5! I like to do panaromic and outdoor scenes, and this is about the widest point and shoot with known good picture quality I can find.If you're going on a special vacation and don't want to take your DSLR and all it's lenses, this is the one camera to take.  It will do super-duper zoom but also give you free range for landscape shots.  A DSLR will give you marginally better depth-of-field if you want to carry an extra 7 pounds around with you.  If you want to fool with this, it will probably give you 90% of the DSLR characteristics, at much more cost and concern about your equipment.A word for amazon users: This was bought 3rd party and the delivery and service was great. Don't be afraid! They even included a cleaning kit and case for the lowest preice.One final tip for people not wanting to do a lot of post-processing- turn the exposure down 1/2 a step for better out-of-camera shots.  Haven't had a point-and-shoot yet that didn't turn out a little over-exposed dus to compensation for smaller sensor size in normal outdoor lighting.Edit 5/9/11- Note to those who don't like the charging through the camera set up- If you have an older P series Nikon, the P500 uses the same battery as a P80.  So I use my charger from that- it does the battery instead of plugging in the whole camera.",

    "text": "I must confess that I am not a professional photographer, nor a serious hobbyist. I just enjoy taking photos. I still use film camera, which I had long preferred and had used regularly until now. I like the convenience of being able to choose and pick photos from a digital camera, but I still think that real photographers use real film cameras. Digital photos can be manipulated; film photos are the result of a good photographer.My first digital camera was a basic no media card that cost $20.00. I next moved up to a 3.5mp camera, which was sufficient for a number of years.For awhile I had wanted to get a bigger and more powerful digital camera that had more options. I was thinking about getting a DSLR, but didn't want to spend so much money. I've been reading reviews about this line of cameras. Nikon Coolpix 500 received a number of positive reviews with a reasonable price. After considerable research, I decided on this camera and I must say that I am pleased with the purchase.It is easy to operate, almost idiot friendly, in fact, and has many options like smart portrait, night landscape, and manual. I love the telephoto lens that allows me to get close up shots of birds at my feeders or in the trees.  The camera makes great use of ambient light, which look even better when I use the flash. Sunset photos with telephoto, flash and night landscape are vibrant.I like the fact that when you forget to take off the camera cap, the camera reminds you to shut if off and remove the cap. Also, the cap can't be put back on into place unless the camera is off. I'm still getting used to and finding my way around the camera, but all in all, I'm quite happy with it.In the box with it comes a hard copy of the Quick Start Guide, which is all you really need, two CD's that contain a User's Guide, editing and photo software, cord for use as USB cord or with the AC plug. It also comes with a battery, strap and camera cap. It is energy savings and shuts off after a few minutes of non-use.It is better than a basic point and shoot, but not a DSLR. Overall, it is a nice compromise.",

    "text": "The most annoying is the blinding red light (for focus) that makes your indoor subjects cringe and beg you not to take a second shot.  The wife, the kids, the cat, non will pose for this camera twice.  It's like hitting the subjects in the eye with a red laser.  Mine came with the newer 1.1 firmware that doesn't seem to have any of the battery or SD card issues.  Good for me, as I was prepared to flash the firmware.  I shot over 200 pictures, mostly outdoor, maybe 10 or 20 flashes, and some HD video today, and the battery still shows full.  I enabled digital zoom in the menus, but I can't figure out how to actually use the digital zoom, something about twisting the control?  It's probably better that I can't digital zoom, 36x is good enough.  It's difficult to tell when you are not in wide angle and want that first 1x normal shot.  I thought I saw a little triangle once below the zoom bar to tell you it's normal, but the little triangle went away.  Focus is slow.  Pictures look great when viewed full screen on the computer, but only fair when zoomed to 100%.  No RAW, not that I ever shoot much RAW, but it would have been nice to see without compression artifact.  Although the 3 inch screen tilting looks great, the eye piece view finder resolution is not optical, poor electronic cam corder, and it looks like you're looking at a window screen.  When using the menu, it still sends the menu to the eye piece rather than the screen (or I wish it did both).  My AUTO pictures are fair or blurry, but switching into some manual overrides for shutter speed are pretty easy and improves quality.  Even with it's sensor VR on, blurry probably has to do with the absence of a lens stabilizer.  But it really ought to work in Auto well, but unfortunately the P500 falls short.  Manual focus is better than most compacts, I was able to use the left side zoom buttons, but it still feels wrong without a ring, like \"drive by wire\" the manual focus has no subtle feel.  The continuous shooting works pretty well, quick enough on \"low\" with good enough quality, but what is up with playing them back?  The Nikon treats the still JPG series like a video on playback, so doesn't tell you how many individual pics there are in the series until you click on \"okay\" to drill into the shots.  Outdoor shots are great, colors look fine, but I didn't but this camera just for outdoors.  This camera is supposed to do HDR, but HDR is not in the user manual's index or any menu I came across.  Not as obvious as, forgive me, the iPhone 4.  Maybe HDR is coupled with \"a scene\" or something ridiculous, who knows, I can't find it in the non-paper manual's index.  Overall I'm disappointed, if nothing else the Borg blinding red focus light puts the nail in the coffin, and I will return the Nikon P500.",

    "text": "Evidently I am hopelessly addicted to photography and I carry a camera with me at all times.  To shoot wildlife I find a dslr with lenses too cumbersome to carry and handle.I am happy with this purchase.  It's mega zoom is great for birding here in Florida, yet it's light weight enough to not tire me out.  Dealing with chronic pain pretty much curtails my activities, and lugging equipment is out of the question.  This camera serves me well.The boot up time really is swift.  I've timed it at just under 2 seconds.  Also when I shoot in succession, which I often do with birds, it fires up at a good speed.I have had a bit of blur when zoomed to the max, but maybe I just need to get used to it, and I didn't have the image stabilization on.The viewfinder is my preference when I shoot, and it seems to be accurate.  What I see is what I shoot.The tilt LCD is a great feature that I had on another Nikon.  I love it.  It's especially good for rising above the crowd, our getting down to low macro's, in the field.I'm looking forward to a bunch of good times with this camera.Oh...I had put it in my basket, but didn't have the money to spend yet.  I had been saving, but was still a bit short.  One day I received an email from Amazon telling me it was discounted that day.  I saved in the ball park of $80.  I was able to get it that day.  What a treat!  Thanks, Amazon!!!I must say, it was after praying \"lord, I'd like THAT camera, and will trust you to make a way\" that it went on special.  So along with thanking Nikon, and Amazon, I truly must thank my lord for making a way, where there was no way. Thank you, Jesus!",

    "text": "Overall, this camera has a lot to recommend it.  It has a 36X zoom lens that starts at 22mm which is the main reason I bought it.  It's reasonably compact and except for a few major items is a good full featured camera.Here are my quibbles:I bought a 32GB PQI memory card and found it was incompatible with the camera.  Apparently, Nikon is not concerned about compatibility as they only support a handful of cards and won't update thye firmware to make it compatible with other cards.  I never had compatibility problems before and this card works perfectly with 3 Canon cameras I own and tried it on.I'm used to Canon and Casio cameras and this is my first Nikon.  I was surprised to find that the camera does not detect rotation and properly handle vertical pictures.  You have to correct the problem in your editing program by manually rotating the effected pictures.The LCD does not swivel completely (it's hinged and only swivels vertically) and is only useful for vertical pictures when using the hinge.  Also, it does not swivel 180 degrees like the similar Canon.There are some annoying software bugs that require you to reset the camera while shooting.  The Nikon web site says one was fixed in firmware 1.1 and my camera came with that firmware but I encounter the problem regularly.  After taking only a few pictures, the camera reports the battery is dead but when you charge it, it takes only 15 minutes or so to be charged indicating that it really was not dead.  I've lost several priceless photo opportunities.  Also, sometimes it starts up in the wrong mode and rotating the mode dial results in bizarre choices.  You have to remove the battery and restart a couple of times to get it back on track.The charger does not charge the battery while out of the camera.  I always carry a spare battery and would like to be able to charge the battery while continuing to shoot.All in all, I wish I had waited for the Canon SX40.  This camera seems rushed to market and Nikon isn't interested in fixing what's broken.",

    "text": "Anteriormente tuve una Panasonic de 6MP y 12x zoom \u00f3ptico, as\u00ed que con la Nikon P500, con el doble de megapixeles y el triple de zoom \u00f3ptico cre\u00ed que iba a hacer magia con las fotos...La verdad, es una magn\u00edfica c\u00e1mara para fotos de personas, incluso en situaciones de poca luz sin flash se las ingenia para tomar buenas fotos sin que queden movidas, es solo cuesti\u00f3n de saber escoger los ajustes \u00f3ptimos. Cone la P500 he logrado fotos de personas que con la Panasonic ni hubiera so\u00f1ado, muy bien por ah\u00ed.Lo malo viene con las fotos m\u00e1s complejas. Soy aficionado a la fotpgraf\u00eda de fauna, principalmente aves, y he tenido problemas serios con el enfoque. En situaciones de poca luz a veces la c\u00e1mara tarda 4-5 segundos en enfocar, y cuando lo hace generalmente no enfoca lo que quiero. Obviamente en esos 4-5 segundos el p\u00e1jaro ya se fue lo cual me frustra bastante...Incluso en situaciones de buena luz, suele tener problemas al enfocar. Lo hace r\u00e1pido y me parece que est\u00e1 justo en el blanco, pero al revisar la foto en grande resulta que est\u00e1 levemente borroso, lo cual es muy molesto pues cre\u00eda que hab\u00eda tomado la foto perfecta. Tomen en cuenta que generalmente para fotografiar un ave hay que hacerlo entre \u00e1rboles y ramas atravesadas, o bien con un fondo dif\u00edcil. Pero a\u00fan as\u00ed, esperaba un mejor rendimiento con el enfoque.El zoom es efectivo y muy bueno, solo que hay que tener buena luz, una velocidad de obturador de al menos 1/200 dir\u00eda yo con 36x zoom porque naturalmente la imagen se mueve bastante a menos que se tenga un tr\u00edpode.Muy buena para im\u00e1genes r\u00e1pidas en r\u00e1faga. Tiene varias opciones, a que m\u00e1s me gusta es la de r\u00e1faga r\u00e1pida, que toma unas 5 fotos en menos de un segundo. Al menos una no sale movida y eso me basta para efectos de las fotos de aves. Luego de la r\u00e1faga tarda unos 3-4 segundos en guardar los datos (tengo SD calidad 10), lo cual me parece bastante aceptable.En t\u00e9rminos generales, es excelente para fotografiar personas, incre\u00edble claridad, buen enfoque, buen zoom. Para fotos m\u00e1s complejas y en movimiento como con aves, el enfoque es deficiente.",

    "text": "This is my first entry into the digital era from the world of film photography.  A lot to get familiar with given the vast array of options this camera affords.  Image quality is generally good, though not tack sharp as I'm used to with my Nikon film SLRs.  Then again, this isn't a high end SLR.  What it does provide is a nice entry to more advanced digital photography than you can get in a pocket camera while still compact and light.  The large focal length range of the zoom in such a compact body is an invaluable feature.  I use it extensively shooting wildlife, to be unobtrusive, and to accurately frame photos the way I want them.  A major deficiency for me is lack of a hotshoe to enable use of alternate flashes and the ability to use a sync cord for off camera flash use.  I don't like being limited to small pop-up flash, which severely curtails effective flash photography.  Because LCD screens can be difficult to use in sunlight, Nikon has provided the ability to switch to viewfinder use, which is a great feature I haven't seen on other non-SLR digital cameras.  I am however a little disappointed in the image quality through the viewfinder.  Surprising for Nikon.  Still, it's a valuable feature I use all the time, not only in sunlight, but because of it's diopter adjustment, which helps me out when I don't have my reading glasses handy, which is the norm.  LCD image is sharp.",

    "text": "We just bought this camera after spending a week or so reviewing all the different ones in this price range. Considered going for an entry level DSLR, but this camera can do so much more and the image quality is still really good. Here is what you have to realize though: only using the camera on its auto setting will leave you very disappointed. This camera can do so much more, but YOU HAVE TO TAKE TIME TO READ THE MANUAL and toy around with all the extra settings and features. Do that, and you will have an incredibly versatile digital camera.Want pictures of your kids? This camera can catch them in the midst of all their crazy antics, but not in the auto setting! Want pictures indoors at low light? It'll do that too, but not in the auto setting! Want action shots? Same thing! Seriously, before you get the camera and immediately think that it doesn't do any better than your old camera, spend a few hours with the manual. A little patience, and you'll be very happy with the quality.I'm barely even an amateur photographer, but once I dared to venture away from the \"point and shoot\" setting I have been extremely pleased and excited with the quality of the pictures I've been taking. Would they win awards? No, but now I can look at all those \"memories\" and not feel like my camera totally ruined them. In fact, I feel like it caught them as well as I could hope to!So don't be scared of all the reviews about image quality, no action shots, blurring, etc. Buy the camera, learn what it can do, experiment, and have fun!Honestly, my only con so far is that the manual is only on CD.",

The girl sitting next to me was able to take multiple shots with one press of her button.  I pressed my button and took one pic, and I missed the shot of the whale breaching because it took too long to be able to press the button a second time.  I could not figure out how to get it to take multiple pictures with one click.  I have tried the sports setting and every other setting and read about it, but somewhere I am just \"not getting it\".  For just normal picture taking this camera is great.  I took some very close up pics of the full moon and I was amazed.  It looked like I was just a few miles away from it!  I know I need to look online and research my issues, or study my manual more. I'm sure this camera must have the capability to take action shots like I needed with the whales.  If it doesn't have this ability, then this is a major flaw with this camera. If you are considering buying it, find out from someone who knows more than I do if think you would like that feature.",

Lots of directions and some are written in jargon that make it difficult to understand if you are new to photography. The video options and quality are great, and had no problem creating videos, however I did need a ripper app to make it iPad compatible. The sport scene was my most anticipated feature, but indoors, you cannot use the flash with it, and some of the pics came out blurry. I am still trying to figure out all of the settings and features, but all in all I am very happy with this camera. I especially like the user setting that I configured for black and white, which are super clear.  If you want fast speeds you do need to invest in the scxd card for speed writing, but that added an additional 150 to my price tag. Totally worth it.In auto mode, you can take pics quickly with virtually no thought required. Battery life is acceptable, I got about 100 pics and 10 videos of approx 4 mins each off of 1 charge, and since I am new to cameras in general, I am always reviewing the pics.I rate this high because I am very happy with it, but I do not have alot of experience with other products to say where it is better or worse than another.",

    "text": "I've owned this camera for over six months now, and have taken at least a thousand photos, several HD videos and slow motion videos. The camera is user friendly with its menus, buttons and controls. I use a 32GB memory card with this camera so it does support it. The battery charger failed one week after I received the camera *thumbs down*... I just use my cell phone charger and computer USB ports to charge the camera when I need to. The charger is simply a USB wall adapter with detachable USB cable.Two things that I don't like (a) the wide zoom angle distorts and blurs the picture around the edges, and (b) the camera can't focus well in low light. Sometimes the camera/lens will keep focusing and never be able to pick up the correct focus setting, even with indoor daytime lighting. Other than that, all other pictures came out great. If you've ever used an SLR class of cameras, don't expect this camera's focus time to impress you; it just takes too long in my opinion (sometimes over 3 seconds).If you're used to shooting simple videos with your cell phone, the HD video with this camera will stun you with clarity (it did to me anyway). I never had anything that could shoot slow motion video so this camera did a great job for my first time. The video is smaller resolution in slow motion, but you could still see amazing detail.Other than the cheaply made charger, I like the camera. It doesn't fit into your pocket so if you decide to walk around with it, expect it to hang around your neck the entire time or in a carrying bag.",

My pictures in the wedding and baptism were of professional quality.  Actuallly my work was better than the pros.  The dance recitals (grandchildren) were indors.  In these cases I  used the scene musem mode.  Unbleviable gread results.  I took HD Movies in the surfer mode and the results were great.  I always used at least two batteries and three during the surfer.  I believe you are supposed to get 30 minutes in video.  I don't believe it. I am very happy with the camera.  I intend to take pictures of more grandchilden playing soccer. I am planning on using the continuous mode for soccer.So far I have only used the P mode,  sceen musem mode and video mode with great results.",

    "text": "Update:  I purchased the SanDisk Extreme HD Video 8 GB Class 10 SDHC Flash Memory Card SDSDRX3-8192-A21 as it met all the requirements in the owners manual.  Finally got an answer.... the  Coolpix P500 will not take a Sandisk memory card if it has the letter \"I\" in it.  Nothing in the description from Amazon nor in the picture showed the letter \"I\".  However, when the box arrived, the description was SanDisk Extreme SDHA UHS-I.  Of course, I did not know any of this until I put the disk in the camera and it said, \"This Card cannot be used.\"It took calls to Nikon, Sandisk and Amazon to get to the root of the problem.  Amazon could not help me find an alternate disk that would work that did not have \"I\" in the name but was a Class 6 or above.  So, I will have to go to a brick and mortar store and look at memory cards.Still can't rate the camera as I've got to go get a memory card._____________________________________________________________________________________________Prior post:Just got the Coolpix P500 yesterday so I don't have a review to write yet.  However, I need help. I read the manual before getting the camera and selected a memory card that I thought would work in it but the camera had an error message that it would not accept the card - SanDisk Extreme UHS-I 8gb SDHC Class 10 card for video and photos.  I put a little 2gb SD card in and it worked.  I know that card would not support the video.So, can anybody tell me what SD memory card works best?  I've already wasted $30 on the disk I bought.  Oh and I called Nikon.... they are no help whatsoever!  And I've always been a faithful Nikon customer.....I own many Nikon cameras.... my prior purchase was the D3x!  I'm so disappointed in Nikon!\n  \nNikon COOLPIX P500 12.1 CMOS Digital Camera with 36x NIKKOR Wide-Angle Optical Zoom Lens and Full HD 1080p Video (Black)",

    "text": "I am Canadian and bought this camera because it was much cheaper than all the cameras I looked at in Canada, even with tax and shipping and the dollar rate. I bought it from a third party retailer. The camera itself was vey good. The packaging was close to nothing (no manual, no package box- it was wrapped heavily with bubble wrap and was in a zip-lock bag, the battery and charger came in another zip-lock bag)The video recording is a bit odd. I put a 32Gb Card in it but it only records 30 mins at a time.The screen and the view finder are both digital and can only be used one at a time. The quality and clarity of the pixels in the screen and view finder was low (like that of an old Camcorder picture quality) but the pictures in the preview option were very high quality. The zoom was also a great feature, but it is a bit shaky when zoomed all the way.Overall a good camera.",

    "text": "I had bittersweet feelings as I packaged this camera for return to Amazon. I really liked the pictures I took, especially those at a distance. The image quality is good enough for my purposes and for a camera in this price range. I like the size of the camera and how it feels in my hands. The autofocus is also good enough for the price. I really like the LCD function and \"swivel\"!However, it has obvious issues with the battery. It would unexpectedly not turn on even though I was sure the battery was not exhausted. After charging for several hours, it would turn on but then I would get a \"battery exhausted\" message almost immediately on the camera's LCD. Once I charged it and took 10 pictures and a 1-minute video over the course of one day and the battery was exhausted. Removing and reinserting the battery worked a few times but not all.I really need a camera that works when I need it to work. There cannot be any guesswork. So I had no choice but to return it to Amazon as defective. Amazon, as always, provides fast shipping and great service, so this is no reflection on Amazon. However, I am disappointed in Nikon. It's not normal for them to build and ship defective products. I wasn't able to get a feel for whether the problem was software, firmware or hardware related, nobody seems to know out across the internet either, and Nikon is still explaining it away as \"operator error.\" Well, as a technology professional, owner of digital cameras since the mid-90's, owner of several Nikon and Canon digital cameras, and current owner of a Nikon D90 (which I love!) and a Panasonic Lumix ZS-7 (which I don't love but tolerate), I'm not amused when a camera manufacturer wants to call it my fault. Nikon, you need to do better. If you face up to the issue and fix it in future P500 productions, I will buy the P500 again.",

    "text": "I have an old film type SLR but I am not that into cameras.  This is the 4th digital camera for me.  I was impressed witht he quality of the pictures from a very compact Nikon so I decided to go with the P500 when my bigger camera got pretty dated.  I am very pleased.  It is easy to take short 1080p videos with and you can also easily take pictures at the same time.  While it has a lot of capability it is no harder to use than my older much simplier cameras.  I really like that the flash does not deploy until you tell it to.  My simpler cameras are always wanting to use the flash when it will not reach the object I am trying to get a picture of.  If you are looking for a camera of this type you should seriously consider this Nikon.  If you think you like it but are scared of somthing with manual exposure control, and aperature priority and shutter priority options as well as a couple automatic settings, you shouldn't be.  You don't have to use these features until you want to.  You can take nice pictures without ever understanding this but if you don't like something, they can be nice to have.",

    "text": "The zoom range on this camera is fantastic.  I bought this camera for a trip where I did not want to take my large and heavy Canon EOS with its 28 to 200 mm zoom lens.  The camera served its purpose, but it is still not comparable to the Canon.  It's the same old delay problem from pressing the shutter button until the shutter actually operates.  I found this to be somewhat annoying on more than a few occasions.  It was also a little hard getting use to the zoom operation being only available with the push of a button, one way or the other.  Even though the zoom is electronic, it is still easier to turn the zoom lens on my Canon by hand, which allows me to frame my picture exactly like I want it.  With the electronic zoom, it often was back and forth several times until the zoom lens would stop where you wanted it to stop.  All in all, it is a good camera as long as you can deal with its downsides.",

    "text": "Since you handle the Nikon COOLPIX P500 we can notice that is more than one single camera, it's a shooting experience. I had  searched a lot types of cameras in Amazon's store, than I decided to take the chance after see many detailed reviews about this machine. I was so excited from the begining until now. When I opened the black box (nice texture by the way) I just start to do every thing slowly to enjoy the moment (here is a tip: go easy to take out the camera from the box and every thing else, put the handle as soon as possible to make sure the camera wont fall). After turn power button on we can see clearly what this baby is all about. Every one around says \"what beauty!\", \"uau, it's awesome!\", \"is it too expensive?\".  Basicly I can prove that it's for real, the word quality can be seen when you see the picture's results at your screen. Also I had notice that Nikon company has a fantastic technical support and advisers for those who may need. So if you want to buy one Nikon, no matter what model, feel safe. Thanks to Amazon to bring the latest goodies and best partners sellers.",

I sold it about a year ago and have regretted that ever since.  I nearly bought a T3I, but couldn't justify pulling the trigger on that much money, plus to get something close to an all in one zoom it was going to run me nearly $1,600 total.I looked at the Canon is30x and the Sony hx100v, but both had some major features that bugged me.  I really just didn't like the look and feel of the Canon and the Sony's sluggish zoom ring and forced picture review turned me off.  After playing with the P500 at target (my local target doesn't tether them so you can actually feel the real camera) I had to have it.The next day Amazon lowered the price by about $40 making it a no brainer.  I've taken a couple hundred pictures and a few dozen videos, even some in slow motion and the more I use it the more I like it.  No regrets.  Thanks Nikon and Amazon for the sale.",

    "text": "This camera has surprised me more than any other.THE GOOD: photo quality, in any setting so far, is great. the zoom is outrageous, 810mm gets you CLOSE. the wide angle it great with some distortion around the edges that you would expect on a lens approaching a fish eye. the smart portrait setting will automatically take a pic only when the subject is looking at the camera and smiles. great anti-shake feature. a super \"auto scene\" option for just the right exposure in any situation. fully user programmable, apature or exposure priority. full 1080p HD and 720p slo-mo video which is pretty cool.THE NOT SO GOOD: battery life (with all the bells and whistles on) is not optimal, maybe 2 hrs of constant use switching from pic to vid. during HD filming, especially in quiet settings, the built in stereo mic picks up the noisy auto focus as it constantly is working. not optimal low-light HD video performance. (of coarse i was trying to video goldfish racing in a bar, so probably not a fair test).in my opinion, a great all in one \"mini-DSLR\"",

The \"A/C adapter\" is a 120v to a female USB for charging directly to the camera.4) Battery takes 4 HOURS and 10 MINUTES to Charge!!! 250 minutes!!!  REALLY?5) Very good metering. Nice flip-down screen! Feather-Light! Takes GREAT shots! (in moderate light)6) Great Stabilization! Kudos here but I'm sorry you have to go back!I keep looking at the Mega-Zoom cameras thinking I need that kind of zoom but really...I don't but am paying for it anyway.

    "text": "This camera takes great photos, but using a tripod is a good idea, when zoomed in on a higher setting, because it is shaky otherwise. The videos are nice too, and the slow motion is cool, but not good for taking videos in a darker setting. You just can't see the video well in darker lit settings, and on the slow motion setting, you can't see the video at all. Otherwise the videos are great and the zoom into a 36X is very cool. It helps to zoom in, then press the shutter button half way, to focus the scene better, then switch to video. It helps the video come in a little better, but on a full 36X zoom, it is blurry, except for perhaps one small object you may focus on. Hope this helps. I love the camera, by the way.",

    "text": "Before I start, these are simply my own impressions. I was once a professional photographer way back in the days of film and photographed over 600 weddings, as well as sports teams and schools. Nowadays I am just an amateur who sells prints once in awhile. I am also a recently retired economics teacher and in my quest to upgrade from my excellent, but outdated D7000, I applied the principles of wants vs needs, trade-offs, opportunity costs, and cost benefits.Realizing the no camera will give one exactly what they want, I narrowed the requirements down. My two main criteria were higher ISO performance and more accurate focus. I do a lot of bird in flight, and both are essential. It came down to the D7200, the D7500, and the D500. The D7200 already being two years out, I ruled it out. The D500 fit my needs, and a few wants, but the price tag was a bit steep. The D7500 seemed the best fit, and after trying it for a couple of days I believe I made the right choice.ISO- While the D7000 had an upper limit of ISO 1600 before degrading, I now feel quite comfortable at 3200 which helps with the 180 f/2.8 for birds. I will test at higher when I do some Milky Way shots next week.Focus- Spot on, fast and accurate. I can track a bird quite easily.Exposure- Amazing. The color rendition and exposure are so good I don\u2019t have to do any tweaking. Even shooting a bird against a bright blue sky the metering handle it.Eight frames per second is fast. The shutter is quite sensitive and I will easily shoot a sequence when only one is needed, but they delete.The shutter is much quite quieter than the D7000 and makes a sweet sound like my old Contax.The negatives that people are sounding off on don\u2019t bother me. One card slot is okay, I never utilized the second slot before, and I am not doing anything that a card failure would cause a catastrophic loss. No battery grip is okay too. I have one for the older camera, but never used it. I am so old that reaching over with my finger feels natural. Not being able to meter with old lenses is okay too, I don\u2019t have any.The bottom line is that this camera meets my needs, and then some, giving me a good return on investment.Update 7/17- After spending a couple of weeks with the camera I am even more pleased. I found the group autofocus and af-c to work the best for tracking birds. I have gone up to ISO 6400 with satisfactory results, in fact I have yet to use the flash.Update 7/21- I have been using the camera at the beach for surfer photos and it performs impeccably. Battery life is a bit short, but that may be affected by the use of a screw drive lens. The sunrise photo was shot with the 10.5 fisheye.",

    "text": "I've had the D7000 since 2011 and always found it hit or miss as far as focus goes.  Spent a lot of time taking pictures of brick walls, angled rulers and focus charts trying to dial in AF fine tune.  I got it as good as I could and could get sharp photos out of it but at times regardless of all that I'd get some images that were off or just overall seemed soft.  At the time the D7000 was considered a good low light camera but I found this is where it struggled with focus the most.  I was a bit disappointed to see the D7500 dropped to a single SD card slot and no longer incorporated magnesium in the frame construction.  For those reasons I tried to pickup a new D7200 but apparently missed the boat and none were to be had (aside from refurb or import).  Ultimately I caved in and went with the D7500 as the D500 is a good chunk of extra money and would require an external flash.  I don't abuse things I own so magnesium frame components aren't a necessity to me and though dual card slots would be nice also aren't a necessity.  I haven't had a card go bad ever and I'm not a professional photographer so I don't require the redundancy.  If I were making profit from my photos I would be paying more for the body with dual card slots.  I don't agree with the statements that the D7500 is a step back from the D7200, it's more like a diagonal step forward.  There are improvements that have been made that make it better than a D7200 but it has moved in a different direction than the D7000, 7100 and 7200 previous models.  It is now the advanced consumer camera the D7xxx line was meant to be rather than the lite version of a professional model.  Overall I'm very pleased with it and glad I got it instead of a D7200.  I don't have the focus issues I saw with the D7000 and the low light performance is vastly superior to that of the D7000.  It also has full support for the new AF-P lenses which I picked up a refurb 18-55 vr for a very low price.  The focus speed of the AF-P lenses is near instant and for video has no detectable noise unlike the AF-S that make ridiculously loud noise while slowly dialing in to focus that is picked up by the built-in camera microphone.  I also found the AF-P lens to take incredibly sharp photos which kind of surprised me since it's a \"cheap\" plastic mount kit lens.",

    "text": "Just a short review, more of a user experience. I bought the D7500 for a month long trip to Europe. I was replacing a D7100 that had some nagging problems that often left me less than satisfied (It had been dropped - and repaired - early in its life, but was never as good as I expected). Anyway, I filled 4-5 64 Gig memory cards on the trip, and I have to say that this camera is far better than my old one. The low light abilities are awesome, and on the few instances where I needed to take a picture hand held in low light with some depth of field, ISO 16000 was a very viable option. Not noise free, but better than ISO 6400 on the older camera. Other features that made the user experience better: I could easily transfer pictures to my phone - very important to my wife and convenient for sharing or posting to Facebook when traveling without a computer. The connection to the phone also meant that I could share the phone's GPS with the camera and therefore get location tags on every photo. This worked very well, though it is possible that it negatively affects the phone's battery - but my phone is old and it is hard to really tell. (I think the automatic download was more detrimental to the phone battery, and it took a little searching to figure out how to turn off automatic downloads for every photo). As for the camera battery, it was also good, though again, the automatic download seemed to affect it a lot, as did a lot of activity on the display. The tilting screen was useful to have, but not as useful as a fully articulating screen (like the D5300). The touch screen was awesome, and made it VERY easy to check critical focus and work with the menu - even with gloves on. I was in a cold weather environment, so I had gloves on much of the time. These gloves had something on each finger that would let it work with an iPhone, and therefore it worked just as well with he camera. I liked the feature where you could use the live preview and touch the screen where you wanted it to be in focus, and it would refocus and take the shot.I understand why people complain about the missing second SD slot, but as long as I carried a second card around, it was fine. I never made automatic backups anyway, and I can live without putting RAW on one card and JPG on the other. It would have been nice, but the other features are more important to me. The depth of field preview seems to be gone, and that is disappointing, but it is usually easy enough to take a shot and check depth of field and then take another. The exposure settings were a little more confusing to me, and I could not reliably determine if the camera tended to over or underexpose. I think I ended up using plus or minus 1/3 of a stop a lot of the time, and sometimes a lot more than that.Overall, I am very happy with the purchase. I might change my mind after reviewing the thousands of photos I took on the trip, but based on what I have seen, it is a definite upgrade!!",

    "text": "I've only had this camera for less than a day and have taken about a dozen keepers. The build quality is outstanding compared to the D3400. The D7500 I believe, will fill the role as an enthusiast camera. Not quite up to its big brother the D500, but at least in the ways that really matter to me it is spot on. BTW, I gave 4 stars for battery life but that is based on what I've read. I haven't had enough experience with the camera to have my own opinion. Also keep in mind that picture quality is a function of the photographer and the lens even more than the camera IMHO.The first big difference to me over the D3400 is the focusing system. I haven't had a chance to use it track birds but the 51 focus points and the 3D and group modes seem to work well in simple tests. We'll see how they perform for me in real world scenarios like tracking a bird. Regardless the focusing system is much better than the D3400. Another important feature for me is the ability to shoot at 8 frames / second and up to 50 RAW photos before the buffer fills up.I love the touchscreen display and the fact that it articulates up and down. I do wish it moved further down for taking overhead shots, but it will work fine. Being able to use the touch screen for menus and photo review is a real plus. \"My Menu\" is a great time saver. You can add your most often accessed menu items to My Menu so you can get to them quickly without scrolling through gobs of menus.Auto-bracketing is an important feature for me too. I often shoot real estate (my wife and I are real estate agents and though we hire pro photographers, I often shoot additional shots). Bracketing allows me to create HDR photos that don't have windows that are all blown out, etc.There are a ton more options on the D7500 over the D3400 or other entry-level DSLRs so if you are moving up or if this is your first DSLR, do yourself a favor and get a companion book. I bought \"Nikon D7500 Experience - The Photography Guide to Operation and Image Creation with the Nikon D7500\" by Douglas Klostermann. Very, very helpful.The shots are from the National Cemetery in Sarasota Florida.",

The last camera I owned was a D90, which no longer works, so this is several generations newer. I like the flip-up LCD and the ability to view shots on my phone via wifi. I bought this because of the wireless features. I took a remote selfie just to try it out and that works. I got a nice lens flare from the setting sun behind me, which is impossible with a cell phone camera. I may not use that feature a ton but it's pretty cool. I mainly wanted to be able to easily download pics onto my tablet while on vacation. I'll get a chance to really see what it can do on my trip to South Dakota this weekend. Looking forward to that! I might try some remote selfies next to Mount Rushmore, who knows? My initial impression was that the camera meters almost a full stop too dark, but I adjusted that in settings. Not sure if that's a default flaw or not, but it could have been the previous user's settings too. I'm looking forward to getting back out there and taking serious pictures again! My Samsung takes some pretty stunning shots, but I miss the full experience of my Nikon DSLR!",

    "text": "Nikon's D800 will go down in history as one of their best dslrs ever made. The D700 used to be go to classic. It was the first affordable FF DSLR from Nikon to incorporate a full frame digital sensor (a year after the D3), but it's title as a classic will fall to the D800.In almost every single aspect the D800 is a better camera than the D700 ever was. The D810 did little to improve the overall experience of the D800. When you use both cameras as I have you see the disparity between marketing claims in real life performance. All of the claims for a more balanced shutter and less vibration of the D810 did little to mitigate or improve the outcome.When you add in the fact that the D810 is a camera that doesn't quite handle as well as the D800 nor sound as good, for example by removing the rotating metering dial around the AEL lock button, and quieting the shutter sound, the D810 is no longer really much better at all. The slightly faster frame rate does not bring it into the category of being a good sports or action camera therefore the specification itself is a bit useless. The D800 will shoot up to 6FPS with an attached grip using the 1.2x and DX crop modes, 5fps without the grip.In order to really jump up in any performance overall you have to purchase the D850. That camera right now is about four times as expensive as the D800 used. The resolution advantage if you want to call it that, is very much minimal at best, at least for most practical circumstances. Nikon's D850 has also turned out to not be that good of a sole performer for action and sports (D series are MUCH better) again making you question what you're really getting for all that extra money. In the real world not much, although admittedly the D850 looks like a much better camera on paper and you're never going to convince a D850 owner to the contrary. Understandable, of course.Working photographers such as myself know that we do not live by marketing claims or by paper specifications. We live by judging a camera's performance in real time in real life circumstances. I've owned or used extensively all three of the 800 series cameras from Nikon, and I can tell you that the D850 is really not much of an upgrade from previous iterations practically speaking.I own several bodies in multiple camera formats because I like to use a camera that works best for a particular type of photography. The 800 series cameras work best for everything except action work. There are other cameras such as the D series pro level cameras and the D500 that are better suited to this type of work.I see many photographers trying to buy one camera body to do everything well, in the end they only end up disappointed because their camera will not live up to all the unrealistic expectations that a marketing department or specifications of the camera would have you believe they could fulfill. Real life is everything, unless you just want to collect cameras that collect dust and compare their mathematical specifications in la la land.From a working photographer's perspective though, the D800 is a fantastic classic legendary camera, and may go down as Nikon's best full frame camera for the dollar of all time. That is why I think it will dethrone the legendary D700 here in the near future. The bang for the buck is amazing.This is not to say that other cameras cannot perform better in certain aspects of performance, that is not my claim at all. The claim I make is that there is a loss on your return of investment when you purchase its successor cameras. The value proposition of the D800 is much higher and the performance is at least 90 to 95% as good as its successors.Marketing departments and shills dominate most of the airwaves online and in writing, this unfortunately is bolstered by forum \"heroes\" that defend their brands and purchases. That is not the world that a professional photographer lives in. Not at all. Therefore my opinion is going to be soundly different than the majority you may read out there. I'm perfectly happy with this fact because I know in the end most people will end up coming to the same conclusion eventually, if and when they become working photographers.The newer mirrorless cameras still do not focus as well as dslrs in critical circumstances for action sequences, and they probably won't ever surpass, but may catch up, to DSLR performance in this respect. Camera companies want you to buy their latest cameras so they do not go out of business. Of course that is very understandable but that doesn't mean that their promises through their marketing departments will live up to your expectations as a photographer.  If you would rather listen to wisdom and save a lot of money, then this review is for you.The D800 is a reliable tank of a camera that is pleasurable to use, consistent, durable enough for generations of ownership, and priced in the used market for an extraordinarily great deal. It's image quality is some of the best that has ever been.Take some advice from a working photographer who has used nearly every DSLR  or high-end mirrorless camera offered by almost every manufacturer.",

    "text": "I am not going to give a full review of this camera since it is likely you are already well aware of much of what is out there. That being said, there are a few things I have noticed which there don't seem to be much feedback on which I would like to highlight. For point of reference I am coming from a D700 and have many of the high end FX lenses.One of the absolute best improvements (aside from obvious things like resolution, improved DR etc.) is the Auto ISO feature. Am I the only one who loved this on my D700 and love it even more on the D800? Nikon has tweaked the min shutter speed setting on this so it is a little more intelligent. Instead of just saying 1/50 or whatever you want as the min (this would be a decent setting for a wide lens) the D800 takes it 1 step further and allows it to float relative to the focal length. In other words 1/50 with a 200mm lens might be a little low in my opinion but the D800 will set it to 1/200 (following the 1/ FL rule). Furthermore, you can tell the camera to set it faster or slower (there are 5 levels with the mid setting as 1/FL) so the same 200mm lens will have some multiple (or fraction) applied to this as well. I like the one step up setting so my 200mm lens never shoots with a shutter less than 1/400. This makes it so much easier on longer length lenses and especially zooms like the 70 - 200 where you might jump around and going back into the menu is a pain to set the min shutter each time... Call me lazy but I love this feature - great addition.EDIT: After shooting 2,000 shots or so with the D800 (and especially with any longer non-VR lenses) I see why this feature has been added... With the D700 the 1/FL rule seemed to work just fine, especially with VR equipped lenses (most non caffeine junkies can get away with far less). With the D800 this rule just doesn't work as well and will produce mixed results. With a D700 and my 24-70 I would shoot at ISO 100, 50mm and 1/50s all day long. On the D800 I have found it is better to go to 1/100 or even a little higher with ISO 200 or higher - the ISO change is a lot less noticeable than the increase in sharpness due to the shutter. With the 14-24 this \"new\" rule (haven't decided yet if the new rule should 1/2*FL or 1/3*FL) isn't too hard to follow but with the 70-200 I find myself pushing the ISO frequently of changing the setting down a bit due to the presence of VR (I use the VRII model). I honestly would not have guessed that the increase in MP would require this much of a change in technique but it does. Of course you can always downsample and still be better off than where you were with the D700 so don't take this as a negative to the camera - just a required change in technique in my opinion. When I first wrote this review I loved the new feature and I still do now but there is one change they now need to make: Recognize VR equipped lenses and allow conditional rules such as 1/2*FL with VR and 1/3*FL without. None the less I just change the setting in \"my menu\" when I use a 16-35VR or 70-200VR (although the longer one can sometimes benefit from just leaving it) and the end result is the same but Nikon made it 90% of the way on the new feature, why not round it out. I did also pick up a grip and use rechargeable AAs simply to add weight & this also helps but D800 + grip + 8 rechargeable AAs + 70-200 is not something I walk around with for hours on end.Other more minor comments:- This is less about Nikon as it is about Adobe but it caught me off guard: LR3 will not read D800 RAW files nor will it ever! You either have to use a converter (add more workflow steps which is unacceptable in my opinion) or upgrade to LR4. I suppose I can see both sides but it is annoying to say the least. Adobe should really support this in LR3. It made me want to use Aperature instead but I also use PCs so that is just a pain.- Built in HDR is a joke. Any respectable HDR shooter will bracket with at least 5 frames and likely use Photomatrix or something similar. It also does not work if you shoot RAW - only JPG and only 2 images hence the joke. Your probably not buying the camera for this anyway.- The quiet mode is also useless. Fractionally less noisy than the std and a waste of a spot on the dial.- The + / - on the image zoom is backwards from the D700. Just takes some getting used to...- Folks, it is a 36mp sensor; you will need a bigger drive and 16GB cards barely scrape by now. I am finding 14 bit lossless compression files in the 50mb range - directly after a format the camera reads 200 available images on the 16GB card. A 2GB card is like an old roll of film now for 25 \"exposures\" LOL. I get that wedding shooters are going to need a lot more bigger drives but you can't have more detail without more space... Yes, people say you can downscale but this poses a serious workflow bottleneck for me. I have also found that in addition to more drive space working with these large files, particularly in PS & HDR SW with a dated dual-core 2.4GHz CPU and 4 gigs of ram in 32 bit mode requires patience. I hate waiting. EDIT: I have underestimated the PC side of the equation on this camera upgrade. I had to buy a new computer with a lot more muscle to handle a 7 or 9 image RAW stack to be sent to Photomatrix. These get really big and processor hungry. I got a PC with dual quad core (8 total) 3.2GHz XEONs and 16GB of RAM. The processors are far more important than the RAM I have found so get a faster processor and 8GB if you must to save $. It costs as much as a nice lens or even a bit more but keep in mind it is used for every image I take... Worth the upgrade in my mind and something to consider if you have an aging PC / Mac.- 100% viewfinder vs 95% on the D700 doesn't sound like much but it is really a welcome improvement.- I have now started buying SD cards to compliment the CFs I already used with my D700. For whatever reason tests I have done on my computer show I am getting faster write speeds out of a 60mb/s Sandisk EX Pro CF card than I get out of a 95mb/s Sandisk Extreme Pro SD card. Same manufacturer but the CF cards just seem to be faster. They are also more expensive - go figure.- I have never owned a D7000 but I hear the auto focus settings (selecting) are the same on the D800. It is way different than the D700 and took me 10 minutes just to figure out how to adjust from AF-S to AF-C. Hint: it is on the front (the side button) to the left of the lens when looking thru the viewfinder.- It has been said before but the fact that this thing has similar high ISO performance compared to the D700 with 3x the resolution deserves a slow clap from Nikon. Really, impressive. I have no issue with using ISO 1600 in auto ISO mode and for certain types of shots see little downside to 3200 unless you are seriously pixel peeping.- Their product launch and way they rolled this out and so dramatically underestimated demand is the exact opposite. Once you have one (a good one without some of the early mfg issues) though you seem to forget all the frustration of the wait.These are just the initial impressions since I have only had the camera for a week or so and shot < 1,000 images. So far very impressed thou and would do it again in a heartbeat. Lastly, in case you are also wondering, I have since cold my D700. Given it still has amazing value I just could not justify it as a backup body and there were few if any advantages that I could really see. I can see wedding photographers scooping these up though as they are a great balance of performance and file size if you are getting into the 4 digit file counts per shoot.",

    "text": "Writing review as a former d200 then d300 and now d800 user. I have been using the d800 for several months now with a variety of lenses in a range of shooting situations. I use the camera for a mix of professional work which includes portraits and product stills, and for fun.Controls:I upgraded from my d300 because I dropped it and the flash was no longer working. The transition has been relatively smooth although I do find that I have had to relearn and remap a few of the controls. The switching of the + and - zoom controls still gets me, and I do miss the old auto focus mode selector that used to be on the back of my d300. I like having the bracketing button in easy access have it set to easily shoot in camera HDRs. Overall I find the control layout an improvement from the d300 especially the one touch live view button, and simple toggle between AF and MF.Using DX lenses:I still use my 17-55 DX lens with the d800 and right now am very happy with the results. I have my custom button set to switch between FX, 1.2x, and DX crop modes which is a lifesaver when using my old 17-55. Past its widest settings I like to use this lens in the 1.2x crop mode to get nice detailed 25mp images without too much vignetting. I have a 27\" imac an on this size screen I cannot tell the difference between a 15mp dx cropped image and a 36mp full frame image but for large prints it may make a difference. One thing I do love about shooting the full 36mp resolution however is penalty free cropping. I had to be careful on my 12mp d300 about not cropping to much and loosing image quality but now I will crop out half of a 36mp file still be floored by the amout of detail. Overall I see no problem with using my DX lenses with the new camera and actually enjoy the added flexibility and creative potential they provide. I sometimes enjoy the circular image the 17-55 creates at its widest setting at the FX crop.ISO:Based solely on my observations I would say the d800 gains about 2 2/3 stops in ISO quality. Before, I would shoot my d300 up to ISO 400 and be completely satisfied with noise, dynamic range, and color quality. With the d800 I can now bump up to ISO 2500 and be completely satisfied with image quality. In low light situations I find bumping the d800 to ISO 5000 is about as high as I am willing to go before the image quality starts to degrade significantly. Auto ISO works much better and is easier to setup.RAW vs JPEG:I like to shoot RAW + JPEG and find that most of the time I am happy with the JPEG. Reading reviews I thought that RAW would provide a HUGE headroom in the shadows and while I find there is a good amount of data in the shadows I would say no more than a stop. Files are very detail but you can definitely see the effects of the anti aliasing filter and sometimes I wish I had sprung for the d800E. By default RAW images are not especially sharp and I almost always need to bump up the sharpness in software. On a positive note in the thousands of pictures I have shot I have yet to see moire.Metering:I find that the metering is much better on the d800 than d300. I rarely switch away from multizone metering as it is just very good at figuring out the scene and I dont have to use a lot of exposure compensation either.Live view:Live view is a VAST improvement from the d300 which was almost unusable. Having a button to quickly pull up live veiw is great! Although live view focusing still leaves quite a bit to be desired it will eventually find focus in most lighting situations.Auto focus:About the same as the d300. Fast and dependable as long as you can find a point with good contrast to lock onto.Overall:I am very happy with my d800 purchase. I recently purchased the 50mm 1.8 and have been using this for shallow depth of field and low light shots and think the color quality and sharpness of this combination is just outstanding. If I could think of a complaint I would say the Live View focusing could be better, and the battery life is not quite as good as my old d300 which was just insane. The build quality is also just a tiny notch below the d300 but overall feels very professional. The rear screen on the d800 is great and I have not had any color tint problems. The left focus problems that have plagued so many other users has not been an issue for me. I would say everything about the d800s image quality is a step better than the d300 and the main thing it has been doing for me is allowing me to shoot more freely. I shoot looser crops because I know I can always crop in without losing quality, and I rarely worry about how high I have take my ISO which used to be a constant worry with the d300. I debated for a long time which camera would suit be best as an upgrade for my d300. I went between waiting for a d300 successor, getting a used d700, slimming down with an OMD-E5, buying a d600 or going for the d800. A direct d300 successor would have been nice but the added depth of field with full frame was a big decider for me as I shoot a lot of portraits. The OMD would be great but I am already pretty heavily invested in Nikon glass and was not ready to compromise on low light image quality. For me the d600 was just to plasticy and I was not happy with the control setup.In the end I am very happy with my decision although every once and a while when I am shooting landscapes I wish I had gone for the d800e.",

    "text": "_*********************************************************** Update 04/15/2013: This update is for event shooters/photojournalists.** Enthusiasts, hobbyists, still life and landscape professionals can skip down to my original review below and call it a 5-star camera.**********************************************************After a year of ownership with three bodies, these are my final thoughts.  This is the best landscape or studio DSLR in the market.  Other than not having a mode dial with Custom User Settings (U1, U2) like the D7000, this camera has near perfect ergonomics.However, I do not recommend the D800 for paid work that have once in a lifetime moments, such as capturing the first kiss at a wedding or truly spontaneous moments, because there is a high probability of missing focus.  When situations have no do-overs, equipment inadequacies are not an option.  This is the reason why I stopped searching for a \"good copy\" of the optically superior Sigma 35mm 1.4 and settled for the more reliable Canon.I have had both bodies and a replacement body (serial 3041XXX) \"fixed\" by Nikon and they felt the last fixes were good enough.  Good enough, I did not invest $18,000 into a system for good enough!  Without getting into the whole left side autofocus (AF) saga, which is readily available on other reviews and websites, the AF is horribly inconsistent even with the latest firmware (A: 1.01/B:1.02) using the center AF sensor.My percentage of focused photos took a massive dive with this camera; I tried compensating by closing down the aperture a few stops, but the increase in depth-of-field area was not always enough.  With the D3/D700, I would wait for moments and capture it with one shot.  The D800 missed focus often enough that I began shooting in spray n' pray style, however, often the focused photo was not what I wanted.  Creating the dilemma, do I give the client a great moment that is out of focus by meters or a ho-hum moment in focus?  When I owned the D3 and D700, I used to shoot 500-1000 photos per event, I was taking 3,000-5,000 photos with the D800.  This MASSIVE increase of photos created a workflow nightmare and my quality of work suffered (subjects centered, ISO's in the 12,800-25,600 range to allow for smaller apertures).Autofocus problems only get worse when in AF-C, if shooting a person walking towards the camera at a slow to medium pace in the F/1.4-2.0 range, expect 1 out of 10 perfectly focused, 1-2 acceptable, and the rest throwaways.  Stop down to F/5.6 and at best it's 50/50.  I took a huge financial hit switching to Canon (selling used, buying new), however, my two Canon 5D MkIII's get 7 perfectly focused, 2 acceptable, and about 1 throwaway running the same test of a person walking towards the camera. Stop down one or two stops for near perfect results.Nikon does many things better than Canon.  In body AF Assist Light, intervalometer, spot metering based on AF point, intelligent Auto ISO, better AF position selector, better access to flash options, and many more.  Overall, less menu digging, and obviously Nikon's megapixel advantage is nice for cropping.The ten plus (I actually lost count) trips to Nikon service centers can attest just how much I wanted this camera to work.  Nikon customer service is beyond atrocious and their technicians are incompetent.  Maybe a few years into production, new D800s will be adequate, but I will never know because I do not see myself buying Nikon again.The Canon 5D MkIII's sensor has less dynamic range, 1.3 bits less color space, but those 24 bits it does have are beautiful colors that require less post-processing for nice skin tones.  Because I am confident that the AF will not miss, I am now shooting 300-600 photos per event, that plus less time in post.  My turnaround went from 4-6 weeks (culling missed focus photos and fixing color) to only 2-7 days with the inferior Canon.  My clients are happier because they are getting their photos fast.  In the end, I prefer focused images taken by an average sensor, than a blurred images taken with a sensor with all the dynamic range and megapixels in the world.BOTTOM LINE:The D800 is perfect for photographers that shoot landscapes with Zeiss lenses, people that like having subjects perfectly centered, or autofocus then recompose photos in the F/5.6-11 range.  However, if you shoot wide open with fast primes and not getting the \"shot\" puts yourself or company at risk, look into another camera.  If my livelihood did not depend on camera equipment, I would have stayed with Nikon.  However, in my line of work there are no do-overs, thus the Nikon advantages gave way to its faults, and after struggling with Nikon's abysmal QC and CS in recent years (SB-900, D7000, D300s, three D800's, 28mm AFS 1.8, 35mm AFS 1.4) and reading about D600 issues.  I will not be buying a Nikon for work anytime soon.********************************************** Original Review*********************************************Below are my observations after one month of ownership.Pros:-----+ Resolution:  Amazing detail when shot with the right glass and settings.+ Dynamic Range:  Incredible, when shooting in lower ISO's it is near impossible to ruin a photo.  Search the internet for \"fred miranda d800 review Yosemite\" to see real life comparisons.+ Color:  I recommend creating custom profiles using a\u00a0\n  \nX-Rite ColorChecker Passport Software\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \u00a0or Adobe DNG profiler for better than Adobe LR colors.+ AutoWB:  Works well in about 70% of lighting scenarios, somewhat better than the D3/D700.  *** See Tip Below ***+ Low ISO:  Having a true 100 ISO is godsend for on-location lighting setups or shooting wide open in daylight.+ High ISO:  The D800 and LR4 do an excellent job in controlling noise.  Using PS plug-ins a properly exposed image can print acceptable 8x10's at ISO 12800 (max for D3/D700's is 6400).+ Tonality:  With a good camera profile in LR4, the tonal range rivals Fujifilm 400H Film.  This is incredibly useful on portraits with 4-1 or greater lighting ratios.  Posterization in the shadows (DSLRs Achilles' heel) is only noticeable on highly manipulated images.+ Handling:  The Auto ISO is easier to engage and the new position of the ISO button is more intuitive.+ Exposure:  Better than D3/D700, but far from perfect.  Contrary to Nikon's literature, it struggles with backlit scenes.+ Battery Performance:  It can get me through a full day's shoot if I avoid extensive LiveView or WiFi use, otherwise I need to use a backup battery.Cons:------ Software:  Nikon software can produce excellent results, but it is clunky and slow.- Handling:  Awkward placement of the mode selector button (to make room for movie record), lacking the D7000 U1/U2 style custom banks, switching of AF modes is not as effortless as the D700.- Autofocus: All 51 points are still too centrally located, no increase in cross-type sensors over the D3/D700, all the cross-type AF sensors are in the middle, like the D3/700, the outer sensors are near useless in low lit, low contrast situations.  * For more details on AF performance, see update above and commentsSummary:Using proper technique, the images this camera produces are superior to any camera I ever shot.  Would I jump systems for this camera?  If I owned a large collection of top-tier gear, NO!  Otherwise, I would consider it if I was not too invested.  Does it equal or better Medium Format?  There are differences in perspective, defraction limits, DOF, FOV, and CANNOT BE COMPARED.  Having shot Canon (AE-1, 630, A2, Elan II, 20D, 40D, 5D mkI & mkII, 1D's), Nikon (FM, F4, F100, D200, D300s, D7000, D700, D800, D3), Fuji (S3, S5), Mamiya (645, RB67), and Hasselblad (H4D-40), I know that they are excellent tools that are capable of creating amazing images.  Pick the one that best fits your needs and have fun shooting.*** TIP *** To improve WB (green cast), use the WB Fine-Tune (pg. 149) and shift Magenta 1 or 2 points or use a X-Rite Passport for every scene change.",

    "text": "You all know what the specs of this camera are. I won't lose your time with that. I have the camera for about 20 days and here are my impressions so far.In the beginning I was very upset by the Mpx number. After just the first shoot, I have to tell you - I don't want to have a camera with small resolution any more. Period!The level of details is astonishing! The images are excellent even straight from the camera - with no edit at all. The dynamic range is excellent.Also the AF is very good. It literally sees in the dark. I tried to take pictures in dark room at night (no light - all lights turned off) and the AF assistant light was enough to focus, without even hunting. I wasn't able to see ANYTHING, because it was complete dark, but the camera did. Daytime I never experienced any problems with the AF.I believe the fast AF and details level are also determined by what lens you use (and I have really good optics), but I do compare with D700 and D7000 and there is significant improvement.I like the ergonomics. It's comfortable to hold, even for quite long time. I like the screen resolution, but it does have that slight greenish tint (if that's bothering you it can be changed in the settings).The only things I don't like are:There is a slight noise even in low ISO values - 400 and above, but it is only when you look at 100% and the noise is very fine grade, extremely easy to remove in LR.I would also like to see some more customization options for some of the buttons - like I never use the WB (well almost never) and since I shoot RAW, for me this is quite useless button.I currently own the Sony NEX-7 and I'm impressed with the level of customization of that camera. You can do all your settings just with your thumb - A, S, ISO, etc. I really would enjoy to see at least some of this on D800.Overall, D800 is a dream camera - I highly recommend it to everyone!~~~~~~~~~~ Update 1 ~~~~~~~~~~~ (after 4 months of use):Lowering my score to 2 stars.I do not change my mind on what I've written before about this camera. Everything is correct, except with one - the AF.I said I didn't have problems with my AF, but surely now I do.And it's the commonly spread left AF points problem.I did not discover it in the beginning, because I rarely use the very left AF points. Few months after the camera was on the market, I started to read reviews, describing this problem, but since I haven't experienced those, I neglected to test myself. Until one day, when shooting outdoor I saw my images come extremely soft and blurry (with 24mm 1.4G lens). I tested with the 16-35mm - same thing. 50mm 1.4G - same. I had inconsistent problems with my 85mm 1.4G lens while ago, thinking first that it is caused by backfocusing. After I talked with the technical department from Nikon I realized that this could be caused by the fact I was shooting kids, and you never can be sure how fast they move, etc.However - this was something different now.I now remembered what I read about the left AF points and when I got back home, I decided to test myself. I downloaded some charts, put those on the wall and started testing my D800.It clearly had problem with AF when the left points are used. The problem is bigger with wide angle lenses at big apertures(small numbers) - especially  with 24mm at f/1.4. It fades away after f/5.6-f/8.And as you switch from wide-angle to tele lenses it also fades, even at big apertures.That's why it is not very easy to discover the problem, until you don't fell in a situation like mine, or just decide to test your camera in the beginning.I contacted Nikon, sent them multiple pictures and they requested the camera for check.I'm waiting now (already about 10 days) and meanwhile reading the latest review from Mansurov's website (how the guy received his camera with fixed left AF, but they screwed up his center AF, which is worse). I hope it will be different with my camera and everything will be ok, but I know Nikon from before - it's not easy to deal with them when have troubles with your equipment.So wait for my second update, once I receive the camera back.Until then my score is 2 stars....and it could go either way..~~~~~~~~~~ Update 2 ~~~~~~~~~~~ (after 3 weeks in Nikon's service center):I can say the camera is repaired in general.I did the tests again and it's fine, but you can still see small difference in sharpness when use left AF points (more top left now, than middle and bottom), but it is acceptable, keeping in mind that this is visible ONLY with my 24mm at f/1.4.At f/1.8, f/2, etc. it is sharp. With the 50mm at f/1.4 is sharp now too.There is another issue though - the pictures taken with LiveView are sharper, than the ones taken using the viewfinder. I'm sending the camera back to be fine tuned.I'm also changing my review to 4 stars - this is otherwise awesome camera, but there are still few issues! Hope Nikon will do a better QC next time.~~~~~~~~~~ Update 3 - The last one ~~~~~~~~~~~ (after many months of use):I'm raising back my score to 5 stars. The camera is so amazing, that one easily forget all bad experience with left AF points (or whatever else) in the past.",

    "text": "Let me first state that this camera will not make you a better photographer. Not even close. It may even make you a worse photographer. Why? because the hand shaking that was forgivable before will now be more evident at 100% zoom. Wait, why are you pixel peeping a 36MP camera? For pixel peepers, avoid this camera at all cost! I'll explain more below.The beauty of a high megapixel camera is that it makes your pictures better at the same megapixel size as your last camera! Let me explain this, for most lens, sharpness differences can be viewed at 100% zoom. Unless you print at gigantic 36MP, which only a very small percentage of pros will be using, it's moot. Now, when you downsize a picture, the pixels are interpolated. Lens that were previously unacceptable at 12MP all of a sudden look pretty decent at 12MP downsized from 36MP! For example, a picture that was taken with slight motion blur at 100% pixel peep will disappear when I re-size it to 12MP. That's the thing, most will not print a 36MP picture at 36MP! You will have to resize it to make prints! It's pretty insane to upload 36MP JPEGS to make 4x6 prints anyway. Although someday, I will hang a 36MP picture on my wall.So what's the purpose of getting a 36MP? First, high ISO noise will be interpolated out of existence when downsized. Second, blurriness will be sharpened out of existence when downsized. Third, your not so sharp lens at 100% will look pretty darn good downsized. You need to compare the pictures produced at the printed size and not at 100% zoom! If you take a picture of your face and zoom in at 100%, it'll be pretty unflattering with all the pores and stuff. Same concept here. So if you buy this camera just to view pictures at 100% zoom, you will all be disappointed because that simply is not the point.Coming from a D90, these are the things that are better.1. Full frame. Your 50mm prime now has a real 50mm FOV rather than a fake 75mm FOV.2. Bokeh. You get to see more of that 50mm FOV which means the bokeliciousness that were lost on the D90 is now there. The further you go away from the focus point, the softer the bokeh is. When the DX picture is truncated, you lose that bokeh. This is why full frame appears to have better bokeh.3. ISO. When downsized, my ISO 6400 looks like ISO 100 on a 12MP. Maybe I'm exaggerating a little...but not by much.4. Sharper image with the same lens. Yes, at 100% zoom, all the short-comings are there to see. At 12MP downsized, it will look very great.5. Cliff Mautner looking pictures. Yes, I went there. I've always looked at those nice midday pictures where Cliff take pictures of his models in front of a green background (trees) and the model's faces has that cool looking rim lights... yeah, I can replicate that! Except his models are better looking. Is this due to the better sensor or the better imaging processor?6. Better dynamic range. When the sun's beating down on you at high noon, dial the exposure compensation down -2EV, shoot without flash, and then fix the under exposed parts without blowing out highlights. Tada, natural light at high noon without flash! Very nice, Nikon!I have no green cast. I have no out of focus focus points (that I know of). My beep on focus function is broken. I turn it on, but it doesn't beep. I don't know why. At 100% zoom, my prime doesn't look that sharp at F1.8 as it does at F4. But I don't care. If you want a camera to test out lens sharpness, this camera is it! But don't blame me if you proceed to throw them all in the trash to buy sharper lens.Is this a better camera than the D700? It depends. Is it worth the $1300 premium for the added functionality? Is a $3000 Channel purse worth $1300 more than a $1800 LV purse? A purse doesn't even take pictures and you sure as heck can't downsize it on command! And yet my wife buys a new one each year. For me, yes it's worth it! I'm referring to the camera, not the purse. Then again, if you were reading carefully, I previously own a D90 not a D700.As a final note, I'm going to read more books on photography because this camera tells me what I'm terrible at it. I look at the pictures on Flickr that people took using this camera, then I compare it with my pictures, all I want to do is to punch myself in the face. If I become a better photographer as a result of owning this camera, then I guess the $3000 is worth it.This is the Internet. Feel free to tell me I'm idiot and that I'm wrong in the comments.Update 6/23/12: (1) The beep issue was resolved by deleting bank A and then use bank B. Unfortunately, my camera has the left focus issue. Most of my lens are fine, however I borrowed a friend's 24-70mm and the left most focus definitely has a problem on this one. In liveview, it works fine. I'm going to wait a few months to see what Nikon says about this before sending it in for repair.",

    "text": "I just happened to be reading a Nikon rumor website the night the D800 was introduced in Japan so was able to order it from Amazon within minutes of when they put it online. Sure enough, it shipped the first day they had it in stock and now I have it!I would class myself as an advanced amateur. I've switched back and forth several times between Canon and Nikon but since the D7000 came out I've been pure Nikon. With this camera I am feeling really good about my decision. For me, this is the ultimate camera. Useful for landscapes, weddings and macro but also good enough for my kids' soccer matches using a DX lens.I've only just unboxed the camera so don't have a whole bunch of observations but I will share what I see so far. My first picture was numbered 53, which I found odd. I reset the counter. I tried \"quiet\" mode, but I don't find it so quiet. With a mirror that large, it will be hard to make it truly quiet. Really all it seems to do is delay the return (flip down) of the mirror until you let off the shutter. No big deal. Focus is very quick. The feel of the camera is very solid and the shutter sound is nice, with authority, although not as sharp a sound as I remember from the D700 (which I tried briefly). Compared to the D7000 that I've been shooting for well over a year now, it looks classier. Specifically I like the fact that it does not have any shiny stuff on it. The rubber (or whatever it is) has a great feel to it.I tried the AF-S Micro 105mm, the AF-S Micro 60mm and the AF-S 50mm 1.4. All performed beautifully. As an aside, I did not like the fact that the 105, despite being a pro lens, is now made in China. Yeah, I know the quality is probably identical to the Japanese made version but it just rubbed me the wrong way. I found a nice used one on eBay that was made in Japan. Saved money too! It was bought in anticipation of the D800, so today is the first I've shot it. Nice lens, looks very sharp and focuses very quickly.Back to tested lenses, I then tested a 20mm 2.8 AI-s (non auto focus) lens that I also bought specifically for the D800 because it is supposed to be very sharp. And I figure I don't need auto focus for landscapes. By the way, the lens was bought brand new (it is still made). Great feel. Anyway, to make it work correctly I had to set the non-CPU lens data so that the camera would know the focal length of the lens and understand the f-stops. I assumed that I would have to set the lens at f22 and then use the command dial to set aperture but actually you set it on the lens itself and the camera recognizes the setting (but only after you set the non-CPU lens data). Prior to setting the data, the camera calls f2.8 f0, f4 it calls f1, f5.6 it calls f2, etc. After setting the lens data, the f-stops are registered and recorded correctly.Finally, I tried a DX lens, the AF-S 18-200 II that I used mostly on the D7000. I plan to continue to use this lens for sports and the like because of the 1.5x magnification and the faster shutter compared to using real FX lenses. When you look through the viewfinder, around the outside of the view you see a black circle since a DX lens cannot completely cover the FX sensor. You also see a black rectangle corresponding to the area that will actually be captured. It's nice. Also, this happens automatically since the camera recognizes that you have a DX lens mounted. I believe you can purposefully set an FX lens to DX mode too, discarding the outside part of the frame, but I did not try this. One advantage to using a DX lens (or an FX in DX mode) is that you can get a faster maximum frames per second. I did not test how many frames per second I got (I presume it was 5 as the specs state) but I did test how many frames I could take before the buffer filled up and the frame rate dropped. I was shooting NEF only. The camera took about 20 frames at full speed before slowing. The card in use was a Lexar Pro SDXC Class 10 (133x) 64GB card.One other thing that my D7000 didn't do but the D800 does is allow easy access to change the Auto ISO settings. Now, you hold the ISO button and spin the rear command dial to change the target ISO (basically the minimum ISO in Auto mode) and what's new (to me at least) is that you can spin the front command dial to turn Auto ISO on and off. On the D7000, as far as I know you had to delve into a menu to do that.",

    "text": "I am a semi-retired professional photographer with 40 years experience. I use 35mm Nikon f4s film cameras, a couple of Hasslelbads and 4\"x5\" cameras. My previous digital camera was a Nikon D70s which served me well. I have been holding off upgrading until a full frame digital camera came out that would allow me to take advantage of my extensive set of Nikon lens...especially the wide angle lens that were limited by the DX format.  But I also wanted to get a camera that offered more than basic functions. I finally found that in the D800 Nikon.First...as a picture taking machine it has impressed me VERY much....more to follow on that. The particular features that have impressed me the most:1. HD video capability2. Handling- while the camera body feels good...the addition of the Meike Vertical battery pack and control really makes it fit my hand well...reminds me of my Nikon F4s cameras.3. Ability to do a lot of image processing right in the camera that I would normally use Photo Shop to do.4. Ability to create custom favorite setups and assign to 4 different master settings.5. 100% viewfinder coverage6. Real time viewing of image on the camera screen in both stills and videos7. Ability to STILL use all my older Nikon AF lens...this was the reason I originally swapped my entire camera system from Canon which obsoleted my older lens with their new cameras.8. Use of two memory cards...Compact Flash and SD...I use CF for high quality RAW images and SD card for video and copy of each RAW image in JPGs.  The backup provides extra insurance and elimates making a coversion to JPGs later.9. Electronic \"level\" in XandY assistance...very handy for architecture.10. Image correction to somewhat simulate a view camera.11. Electronic grid in view finder ...use for same reason as #9.12. HDR capability very useful for strong lighting differences.Things missing that I would like:1. ability to record sound bite with each still picture2. I use AAs in the accessory Mieke grip....would prefer to use AAs in the body also as they are obtainable in an emergency from just about anywhere. I use the included battery in the body but set the camera to always use the AAs first. The included battery is 1900mAhr whereas I can get 2800 mAhr rechargeable batteries which give more exposures although not dramatic.Now about the most important thing in any camera....image quality.I am noted for my larger print sizes...generally 16\"x20\" up to 17\"x25\" printed on my Epson 3800 Pro printer or even larger printed commercially at a lab. As a medium format and 4\"x5\" user I often print large sizes and at very high quality levels that have been magazine covers,shown in galleries, etc.  I decided to try some tests for sharpness, color fidelity, image smoothness and noise (grain to film users). I shot at ISO 100 a few flower images under controlled lighting conditions to maximize range. On one I noted a couple of ants walking on the flower so decided to see what it would look like blown up to huge dimensions. I enlarged the full frame image so that it was 10' wide. I than cropped a 8\"x10\" piece of that print including the ant. I was amazed to see that the ant was still extremely sharp and detailed and the noise/grain was still not evident. This all was not modified from the raw image using my normal \"trick\" of using a fractal program...just used PS to enlarge the image. In truth this image quality was as good as my best Hasselblad images (but no my Hasslelbad is NOT for sale).I think this is probably the camera to get if you want the best image quality in the Nikon Line. The top of the line Nikon camera (at double the price) are probably better for sports photography but that is not my interest. The 36MP FX chip does indeed do its magic if your subjects are portraits, product, architectural, scenic. As a side note...you can shoot at very high ISOs and the noise is very acceptable. The abiliity to automatically use noise reduction for very high ISOs and long duration exposures if very handy too.Overall...this is a superlative camera but it has an incredible amount of features so don't expect to just pick it up and start shooting....if you do you will miss all of its \"good\" stuff. Take the time to read the user manual a couple of times and try all the examples out.",

    "text": "In mid to late 2011 I decided that I would move to FX primarily (and m4/3 for lightweight/portable).  I had been using a pair of D7000 bodies semi professionally, but good as they were there were problems that just got in the way.  The primary one is the depth of field control the larger sensor allows.  A close second is lens availability.  There is no 16-50mm f/2.8.  The 70-200mm f/2.8 is too long at the short end on DX for event work.  There are no PC-E lenses.  The options for 16mm are very limited and awkward, even with 3rd party lenses.  All of which is unfortunate because the D7000 handles pretty nicely especially with the grip.  I had used a D3 and D700 as stop gaps while I tried to settle on a D4 or D800 (or D700 or D3s or D3).  I wanted good video as a possible option; I wanted the new generation AF system and controls etc. etc.  Just all the little things that would be better about the new generation compared to the old, so I pre-ordered both a pair of D4s and D800s, the D800s from Amazon on Feb 7.  While waiting for them, I canceled the D4 ... basically, the frame rate wasn't something I needed and the flexibility of using the D800 without grip + the extra pixels won out.  Especially at a $6k discount!It's been a decidedly mixed bag since. On one hand, the handling, image quality, and low ISO performance, cropping flexibility are everything that I hoped for and more, there has been a lot of friction as well.I had a trip to Yosemite scheduled with me departing May 13.  Though Amazon estimated delivery by April 30, and mid April  I contacted Amazon to confirm the estimate, the bodies didn't show up until May 14.  Splitting CF/SD slots is annoying.  One or the other, eh?  $450 for the battery grip is grating, even if you have become accustomed to Nikon's gouging on accessories.And now, the cherry on top, the dreaded left focus issue.  On both bodies.  I had been driving myself nuts trying to figure out why some of my pictures were OOF.  I have pretty good technique and usually get good hits.  My subjects move sometimes so I thought that might be it.  Something was bothering me and I couldn't figure out what.  Then I ran the test and >.< two defective bodies.  I had hoped to exchange via cross shipping the defective D800s Amazon delivered to me.  No luck with that, the window apparently closed June 14 so July 17 is right out.  They did inform me that I could contact Nikon.So I did.  I'll just say that the tech rep I spoke with there wasn't too impressed with my plight.  Suggested that I upload some test shots to \"my nikon\" and in 2 or 3 days someone would get back to me, and we would go from there.  If it needed repairs maybe in 2-3 weeks I'd get my bodies back.  Renting 2 D800 replacements for 3 weeks while Nikon fixes the defective units they produced would be north of $1000.  Not impressed with the help I'm getting here, especially from Nikon who messed up big time.So I have a product with lots of spectacular qualities.  And lots of downsides.  And not a lot of help from the manufacturer when I run into trouble.  If felt better about other aspects of Nikon beyond the engineering the D800 is a 5 star product, hands down.  As it is, if you buy one you have to buy the Nikon organization too, at least after 30 days.*** Edit *** There have been some posts questioning the left sensor focus problem.  I have posted to flickr the test I conducted on a tripod with a cable release and lit by flash; you will notice that all of the live view and the right phase detect sensor produce acceptable focus; the center phase detect is marginal and the left phase detect sensor is awful.  This was try for both D800s I purchased from Amazon.  As of 7/23/2012 I am still waiting to hear back from Nikon.  A downgrade from 3 stars to 2 seems more likely.*** Update 8/1/2012 **** Changing review from 3 stars to 2 stars.  Nikon didn't even look at the photos I sent them before yesterday.  Then all they did was email me back stating the photos had been \"edited in some way\".  They hadn't, but apparently Nikon considers NEF->Lightroom->JPEG editing.  So I tried to upload the NEFs.  But their web application won't accept the NEFs their own camera generates!!!!  I uploaded the nefs to my own website and sent them a link.  I asked them to acknolwedge.  They didn't.  I called and the support said they were \"after hours\" and couldn't help me because HQ had the case.  HQ still hasn't responded.  It's ridiculous;  The images show what Nikon has seen many many times before now.  Left phase detect sensors that are badly calibrated.  They are making me jump through hoops for what purpose rather than telling me when they will fix their defective product.  Beware buying Nikon the company along with the body.  It's really too bad that they managed to royally mess up such an otherwise excellent product with their \"support\" culture.*** Update 8/17/2012 *** I received the first one back from NikonUSA and with some quick testing the focus seems to be spot on.  MUCH better across the sensors than previously.  Also, NikonUSA is being responsive to my concerns.  Back to 3 stars.",

    "text": "As a background, I've been shooting SLRs for nearly 35 years.  I've owned and loved my Nikon D300, battery grip, and Nikon 24-70mm f/2.8 and 14-24mm f/2.8 lenses for nearly 5 years.  I was ready to upgrade to a \"hybrid\" stills and video camera, but my primary passion is stills photography.Like most folks, I was extremely excited about the D800 when it was announced, but paused as it became clear that there were some manufacturing problems that were being sorted out.  I waited a year and recently purchased a D800 body with serial 305xxx from Amazon, thinking that surely the left-focus issue was behind us.  I was incorrect.I received the camera, charged the battery, put it on a tripod, and tested the left focus sensors.  The problem was glaringly present, obvious without a fancy test.  My camera body appears to be manufactured in June of 2012 based on the factory date setting and the firmware update.  I put it through a few tests to see how bad the problem really was then decided that the camera body was going back.  Discounting the left-focus problem, here are my observations from my brief tests:Image quality: Simply, utterly amazing (when you use the center focus point).  Dynamic range is remarkable.  For pros and serious amateurs it would seem the image quality is the best you can purchase in this form factor today.  The high ISO noise performance is every bit as good as the 5D Mark III per sensor area (not to be confused with per pixel noise performance, which is not a useful metric these days).  At the end of the day, some might argue that stills image quality is all that matters, and the D800 has this nailed.Autofocus:  Seems only slightly different than the D300, with one exception.  Face detection through the viewfinder actually works and seems to aid not only candid photography, but also sports/action where faces can be detected.  This feature does not require Live View.  I didn't upgrade the camera to the new firmware release, but I understand this improves AF even more.  Good-to-great AF over all.Ergonomics:  The camera is BEEFY but the grip is remarkably small.  The grip finger grooves on this full-frame camera can fit only 2.5 out of 3 not-overly-large fingers.  Also the little thumb groove on the back is barely present, so it feels a bit like holding a 2x4--not terribly confidence inspiring without a neck strap.  The exposure mode dial is far too tight, not readily adjustable with my thumb like my D300.  I do like the new AF-S/AF-C control button and dials, which seems like a nice improvement over my D300.  The mode button has been moved to make room for an unnecessary video record button.  Why the extra video button when you already have a video mode?Video quality: Moire/aliasing was present when I took my first video of some yellow-pad notebook paper that I taped upon on the wall to test for possible focus problems.  Not sure why this wasn't fixed in the latest firmware release.  The necessary low-pass filter (anti-aliasing) algorithms are well established in the embedded DSP industry and should be possible to employ in-camera with no great difficulty, as evidenced by the D5200 and D7100.  The only real obstacle to solving this otherwise easily avoidable problem (in any camera) is inadequate processor performance.Overall: I'm not sure why Nikon hasn't taken the high road with their customers regarding their recent manufacturing problems.  It would seem their lack of transparency (more than anything else) has created a real customer flight risk and business problem for the company.  Prior to Nikon's handling of the D800 and the D600 manufacturing problems, switching to Canon had never crossed my mind.  Today as I try to upgrade my Nikon body, it has become a real possibility for me.  I really hope the next D800 body is a good one.  I will know tomorrow.======================================UPDATE: Second D800 body serial number 305xxx has the same left focus defect and cannot focus correctly using the left focus sensors.  It is also going back.======================================",

    "text": "This camera is possibly my favorite thing I've ever purchased. It's an absolute beast. My wife and I are both photographers of different types. She does portrait photography (newborn, family, etc) and I do landscape/astrophotography. For years we've been on the very-mid-range D5200. We bought it while we were still both working part time in school, so we had to go for the best one we could on the extremely limited budget we had. While it has served us well, it's obviously a cropped sensor body and it was time to upgrade to full frame, and many years later we're in a far better place financially. (READ: No more school tuition and full time job yay) We figured if we're going to spend the money on full frame, we might as well get the \"dream camera\", so to speak, and not feel like we need to upgrade again soon.And so we come to the D850. Lots of research went into the decision to go with the D850, there is no shortage of videos and reading material about it, it's a landmark camera body for many reasons. Sure it's pricey, but this sucker is going to last us for years and years. I'll try to touch on all my personal favorite points, but there are literally so many that I'll probably forget some, but here we go.Body:Super well designed, comfortable, if not a tad on the heavy side. It's a beast of a camera though, so I can absolutely forgive the weight, and it's by no means uncomfortably heavy. Just a tad heavier than I would have thought. The weatherproofing is excellent. You can watch tons of review videos where you'll see them leaving the camera on a tripod in rainy weather to do a timelapse, and then they simply dry it off with a towel later. As a result of the weather proofing there is no built-in popup flash to make it far more sealed off. This doesn't bother me at all because I never use that flash, if I need flash I'll use an external one.Autofocus:If you know anything about the D850, you'll know that the autofocus in the body is industry leading. (the same autofocus as the D5) A huge number of autofocus points, incredible focus speed, it's absolutely incredible. I will simply leave this at what I've said so far since that's really all that needs to be said. It's awesome.Controls:Having come from the D5200 I feel like the controls are much more intuitive and better placed so as to be more ergonomic. They feel much higher quality than the D5200 which just helps with the overall premium nature of this camera. As a person who loves to do astrophotography, one of my favorite tiny improvements is the illuminated buttons! I don't know how I survived without that before this. It's one of those quality of life improvements that just makes so much sense when you finally have it.Memory Card Slots:So as I'm sure you're aware by now, this camera has two slots. One SD slot and one XQD slot. I originally thought I wouldn't get an XQD card, they're so much more expensive than their SD card equivalents, and I hadn't done much research into them, so I thought they were basically a chunkier SD card. I have since done the research and bought a 240 GB capacity card. The read/write speed is seriously blazing fast. Basically it can keep up with the D850, whereas an SD card by itself will start slowing you down during continuous shooting because it can't clear the buffer fast enough. Transfer speeds to my computer are so much faster than my SD card. (note that you do need to buy a card reader for it) It's also incredibly durable which is a great thing to not worry about when you're in more rugged environments. My only complaint about the D850 now that I've bought into the XQD vision is that they only have one XQD slot and one SD card slot. I understand that XQD isn't widely adopted right now, and that increases the barrier to entry for this camera, but I do wish that there were two XQD card slots in this camera rather than one of each. I have a large enough card, however, that I haven't had a big enough session that I started writing to the SD card yet, so that's not that big of a deal. (I usually remove everything off the card when I import right after my session, so I always start at empty)Touchscreen/Live View:I was skeptical that I would ever use the touchscreen aspect of the screen but I must say I was wrong. I use it very often. The screen itself is large, bright, and great resolution. You can pinch to zoom on your pictures and zoom in to see some incredible detail this camera takes. (something I couldn't really do before until I was on my computer) It tilts up and down, a really handy feature that I forget about too often. (as I stand on my tiptoes to see when the camera is up high, I suddenly realize I don't need to do that, the screen tilts) Live View is also incredible on this camera, again I use it far more than I thought I would. You can even autofocus on specific areas/objects by simply tapping the screen. It's incredibly useful, and the screen is high enough quality that it really does your pictures justice. Very impressed with it.Timelapse:You can create a 4k timelapse video right in-camera. You can even create an 8k timelapse using the interval mode and the full resolution photos able to be taken by the D850, although this is not stitched together in-camera, so you'll need to do that yourself. There are some incredible timelapses out there produced by the D850 that you can watch, the image quality is exceptional. You can also use Silent Live View mode, and that'll not use any mechanical shutter. As stated in the camera's product description, this is great for saving on shutter cycles and improving battery performance.Video:In addition to the photography I enjoy, I love shooting video. As everyone knows, Nikon doesn't do as well as Canon in this regard. Of all Nikon's cameras, the D850 appears to be the best when it comes to shooting video. The autofocus while shooting video is not good, so you'd better settle on using manual focus. None of this means that the D850 will produce bad video. If you know how to work around some of the annoyances and less-than-stellar features, you'll get video that is just fine. Most of us, however, aren't getting the D850 for shooting video, so let's talk about the true purpose of this camera.Image Quality:Thus we arrive to the most important aspect of any camera review, the image quality. This is actually a section where I have very little to say, partly because I covered a lot of supporting info, and the other part because it's quite simple. This camera is a beast. It's got a whopping 45.7 megapixels. This was a major upgrade for me, coming from the 24.1 megapixels in my D5200. I'm incredibly impressed with the sheer amount of data collected in the RAW images especially coming from my D5200. The amount of detail I can bring out in post is impressive. As such, the RAW files are very large, so hopefully you have plenty of storage space. It has great low-light capabilities, and the autofocus works surprisingly well even in low light. I can't think of a single complaint about this category, which speaks to the incredible images this camera produces.If you can afford it, I can't recommend this camera enough. It's an incredible piece of technology, one of the best cameras you can buy. If you are looking for an incredible full frame DSLR with no compromises (minus video of course) then look no further than the Nikon D850.",

    "text": "The D850 is a big improvement over my D7000.  Using the same lens and exposure, the D850 does a noticeable better job.  Can't tell if it is the increased pixel density, lack of anti aliasing filter, or what, but a definite improvement.Haven't used all the available options, but life is easier with the D850.  Focus stacking is so much easier.  The D7000 would do it, but only after being tethered to my tablet/phone or connected with wifi using the TP-Link.  Still not clear on how the length of a focus step is calculated, but just following the instructions have worked well so far, even when doing macro with tubes.  Focus Peaking makes using manual lenses, including the Celestron C5, so much easier.  Nice to have HDR as a menu option.  I do like the HDR option on qDSLRDashboard better with up to 19 exposure available instead of only 3, but then I am back to having to carry my tablet again.  With the improved dynamic range, also a noticeable improvement over the D7000, HDR may be almost a thing of the the past.The D850 is supposed to get more photos per battery than the D7000.  I think it will but you have to leave the live view/touch screen alone and that is hard to do.  It works very well.  Easy to see in bright sunlight, focus and shoot by touching the screen, using focus peaking, or setting up many of the on camera options require its use.  The electronic shutter, with no noise or vibration, only works in live view.  I can go through a battery on the D850 way faster than with the D7000.Do miss not have a IR shutter release.  It was so simple and quick to use on the D7000.  Had to do a search on the internet to verify it wasn't on the D850.  Still haven't figured out a fast way to do a wireless shutter release.  Snapbridge is always there, but that is not fast.  You could change your mind by the time that gets set up.  It requires the WIFI connection to work.The WIFI connection was a big disappointment at first, still not my favorite thing, but I have found a procedure that gets it up and going every time.  Ignore the instructions when you try to connect with wifi.  The bluetooth hasn't been a problem.  Use the camera menu to turn it on and, if the phone/tablet is paired, it will quickly connect.  The only thing bluetooth can do is use the phone/tablet GPS data to geotag your photos, update the time/date on your camera, and turn the camera wifi on.  To turn the camera wifi on select \"Download pictures\" or \"Remote photography\" on the Snapbridge app on your phone/tablet.  Every time I do this I get the message that the connection has failed.  Ignore that and go to settings on the phone/tablet where you can now select the camera wifi on the list of available wifis because Snapbridge did turn it on,  and select connect.  Then go back to Snapbridge, select \"Remote photography\" and it will connect.  Haven't found Snapbridge to be all that useful to control the camera so I usually go to qDSLRDashboard and connect with it.  Works great and works every time, but why can't I just have a menu option, ON THE CAMERA, to turn the wifi on and off.The other annoyance with the D850 was the cover for the hot shoe not being provided.  I thought at first it must have been left out when the camera was packaged.  Nope.  You just don't get one.  Over $3000 dollars for a camera and you have to get your own cover for the hot shoe.  This is not my first new Nikon camera but it is the most expensive.  I am almost positive this is the first time I had to go find my own hot shoe cover.  It is a nice cover.Hopefully Nikon continues updating Snapbridge and the D850.  I do like the camera, but I will still find uses for the D7000, like long range backpacking, since it is lighter and easier on batteries.  But then again, the D850 is only about 1 lbs heavier and I think I could learn to leave the live view alone....maybe.UpdateThe latest firmware update, part C 1.10, added the option to turn WIFI on/off to the WIFI menu on the camera.  Snapbridge is no longer needed to control the camera WIFI.",

    "text": "I've been using the (much more expensive) Nikon D4 for my food photography since 2013, but as soon as this camera was announced, I realized it would be much better suited for what I do - high frame rates and high ISO performance just aren't that important to me. Now I've finally bought it!Generally, I hate straight-out-of-the-box reviews where folks have barely used the product, but I've learned enough in five days of shooting that I feel confident sharing some well-informed first impressions. I'll update later if anything changes.Here's what I love about this camera:- Between the massive image size and the (about damned time) removal of the low-pass filter, image quality and detail is dazzling. Boggles my mind that other cameras have a filter that blurs detail to avoid moire. You can fix moire in Photoshop, but Photoshop can't reclaim the detail lost because of that filter.- The focus shift function. I do a ton of focus stacking, and this camera automates (and perfects) the process of acquiring a series of shots that, when combined in Photoshop, capture everything in focus. I shoot stacks in about 1/10th the time now, which is really important for food - the longer you shoot, the more greens wilt and the more sauces congeal.- Wifi. About time, Nikon! And amazingly, I have actually gotten the SnapBridge app to work, though it's clear from reviews that most people have had a lot of trouble with it. The CamRanger I used for my D4 had more functionality than SnapBridge (I especially miss the histogram), but the live view quality is a LOT better in SnapBridge, and viewing photos is a little easier. For what I need, it's adequate.- Roll and pitch indicators in the viewfinder, not just in liveview.- Touchscreen makes menus easier to navigate (and it's a LOT easier to \"type\" in it now, though a QWERTY keyboard would've made that a little easier)Here's what I don't love:-EN-EL15 battery. Really, Nikon - you give a serious camera that takes 50MB photos the same battery that my old D40X and Nikon1 use? That is NUTS. An impressive beast like this needs an impressive battery, like the EN-EL18. Yes, I know you can accessorize to use that battery, which I will probably end up doing, but the D850 should be built to use that battery right out of the gate.-No built-in bottom grip for vertical shooting. Again, this is an impressive camera for serious photographers; it's silly that I should have to pay extra to add a grip. I shoot a lot of verts, so I'm sure I'll end up adding the grip (Vello for $100, not Nikon for ***$400*** - wtf?), but I shouldn't have to.Obviously both of these items would have added to the cost, but I gladly would have paid another $500 for this camera to have those features built in.- Settings banks, and I'm going to just quote Ken Rockwell on this because he says it well: \"No camera-state presets, just the same clumsy 'settings banks' Nikon has used since 2003. The lesser cameras (D750 and down) are better here as they have two mode-dial settings, U1 and U2, that let us recall complete sets of camera settings with just one click.\" The settings banks just recall the camera the last way you used it, so you have to be extra careful to check whether you changed an important setting on your last shoot in that settings bank.- For men only. Not really, but I'm still irritated as hell at Nikon for their 2017 publicity stunt for this model: sending 32 pro photogs across Japan to test the camera, but not including a single female photog among them. I've been a journalist since 1988 and I did not have one single newspaper job where there weren't a TON of female photographers. Nikon's oversight was stupid and insulting; I hope they never do that again.",

    "text": "This is the camera Nikon needed to release. Please allow me to explain.Over the last 12-18 months I have found myself migrating away from my D750. For our production company I do about 50% stills and about 50% video.  For video I use my GH5 - which for video - is a unbelievable.  However.... it isn't that great for stills. The low light performance isn't great and as a whole... it lacks the finer points of higher end cameras. So I would use my D750 combined with my Otus 55mm for stills. The Otus is a beast - a fantastic lens that significantly outperforms the sensor on the D750.This combination of the GH5 is fine for the studio... but when I travel it just becomes too much to carry. For travel I use a Fuji X100F -which is a fantastic little camera. It has a 50mm equivalent lens and produces photos that are the same resolution as my D750+Otus combo but with marginally  less sharpness and color accuracy.So my dilemma... why use Nikon equipment at all? I am not shooting sports or using telephoto lenses. Nikons are not superior for video.... and some of high end compact cameras nearly equal their performance (if you are primarily shooting mid-focal length primes ). Frankly, my Nikon D750 was ONLY being used when I was pairing it with a specialty lens. Sure there was the D810, but the increase in functionality didn't exactly overwhelm me. So - even in the studio - I was reaching for my Fuji X100F while leaving the larger Nikon D750 on the shelf.Enter the Nikon D850 This is the camera they needed to release. The new sensor and increased resolution gives me a very compelling reason to use this camera. When combined with my Otus 55mm lens I have something that closely resembles medium format.  I can crop, crop, and crop and still get excellent  resolution and edge contrast.  It is amazing. When used with autofocus lenses (like most normal people) I find it to be fast and extremely accurate. Easily the best I have ever used.The D850 low light performance is also much better than the D750. Again it is the best I have ever used. I have taken high quality photos at ISO 3200- and honestly it is workable all the way to 12,800. While the GH5 still has many more video features than the D850. That does not mean the D850 is a one trick pony. I can carry it on location with confidence that if I have issues with the GH5 the D850 can step in (or be used for B roll).  Even better the D850's large sensor can provide far superior DOF control and low light performance.  In fact, for some controlled interview settings I would speculate that the D850 could be the DSLR that you could use (when paired with a high end lens). The D850 sensor beats the GH5 and I would put Nikon's glass up against Sony (but that is just me).A few things to remember- Buy the high speed SD cards. They are crazy expensive, but they will fit directly into most computers while allowing you take photos almost as fast as you can push the button.- This camera will start to expose lower end lenses.  Consider the price of high quality glass into your equation for your overall investment.- Most importantly... what are you doing with your camera? This is not... I repeat... NOT ... a camera for beginners. I would say that unless you are a real enthusiast or someone who uses their camera as a tool to make money you probably do not need the D850. If you can't answer the question \"What specific feature of this camera do I NEED to aid me in taking (insert type of photo)\" then don't buy it. Not only do you not need the D850 - it will be a hindrance to you. The menus can get complicated. The files will be unnecessarily large. If you shoot JPEGS in automode - do yourself and your wallet a favor and step down in camera.Final verdict - A hand-down improvement in the Nikon line-up.  Unless you need the high speed output of the D5 I am not sure why any pro wouldn't invest in the D850.",

    "text": "I only got this camera a few days ago so I'll try to update my review as I go.  I'm upgrading from the d800, which I looooved.Pros:- Touch screen is nice (with some caveats)- Resolution bump is nice- Improved Live View functionality, tap-to-focus-and-shoot is neat!- Viewfinder is muuuuch better- Shutter sound is nice.  d800 was cool but loud, sounded like a guillotine coming down.  This is much quieter.- Flip screen is definitely useful, especially for video.- Video quality (especially color) is better.- Focus system is improved, though far from perfect.  Face/object-tracking is nice but hit-or-miss.  Re-selecting a face/target is confusing.- Automated focus bracketing (and later stacking) opens up some fun opportunities.Cons:- Some low ISOs actually seem *noisier* at 1:1 than the d800, including ISO 400.  Weird...  Obviously with the added resolution you can resize to 36mp and get some pretty nice clean results, but I was still surprised by this.- Video still not that useful for handheld (more details below).- Rolling shutter.- Video still 8-bit and thus has very limited utility in the end.- Thumbpad is smaller, new joystick selector might be useful in the long run but at first it feels a bit convoluted as a second selection pad.- Snapbridge drained my battery in one day (while the camera was off) without actually transferring anything useful.- Menu system is super dated and doesn't really take advantage of the touch screen, and the entire wifi/bluetooth system feels underdeveloped, to put it lightly.- I actually used my in-camera flash occasionally so not having that is significant.- No GPS.  I could probably buy shoes now that have GPS so not having this in 2017 seems silly.- Battery charger does not include extension cord, so you can only plug directly into the wall, which may pose problems with crowded outlets.  I think for $3,200 they should throw in a 50 cent cord.Regarding video:  It baffles me that cameras that can record 14-bit beautiful images don't offer the option for 10-bit video.  I get that storage/bandwidth may be an issue, but this should be a priority for all of these DSLR companies.  In 4 years I'm seeing great improvements in resolution, but what good is resolution when I can't tweak results in post and my sky will always blow out if I expose for everything else?  It would absolutely be possible to shoot video with acceptable color in a very controlled situation.  But if I have that much control, I'm likely to be on a budget where I can afford a camera with high-bitdepth files.  So frustrating.If you read the manual, while it's true that you can shoot in 4k, there are SO many caveats that it's insane.  Nearly every cool feature is disabled if you're at that resolution.  Notably, while there's a feature that digitally smooths camera motion (by shaving off the outer edges of the picture), you can't use it at 4k.  You can do it in post, of course...The pros absolutely outweigh the cons.  In the end, I bought this for the image quality, and it's pretty great.  There are enough changes to the features and controls that I literally am reading through the user's manual and trying to absorb the intended workflows.  I was hoping my jaw would drop at the results, but this feels like incremental improvements.  I won't be surprised if DXOmark calls it the best sensor on the market.  But having waited 4 years, I guess I was hoping for more.  I've barely scratched the surface on what you can do here, but early buyers need to know about some of these details.UPDATED 10/12/17:I was able to capture some decent video in terms of color, where the range in the scene wasn't too bright.However, I'm finding the autofocus system in video mode to be absolute GARBAGE.  Plan on manually focusing.  Relatedly, I have focus peaking turned on, but it seems to only work when in Liveview *stills* mode, not video.  Still need to figure out why I can't see it when shooting video.Regarding my above comment on noise at low ISOs, it seems to only show up occasionally.

    "text": "I am not a professional photographer, but I do consider myself a serious-enough amateur to spend the amount this camera costs. I had been using a D810 previously and I kept the same trio of F2.8 zooms that I had been using with the D810.In the month, my main focus was two weeks of shooting during a family trip to Greece and then videoing a house concert that my wife and I sponsored.Plusses:1.  Even contrasted with the D810, the bigger sensor is worthwhile. In particular, if you are going to blow up a portion of an image, bring on the pixels!  Using a Nikkor 70-200mm zoom with a 1.7 extender (the largest extender I've tried that does not visibly degrade the image quality, you can do more to bring out far objects in your shots. I know this will matter to me when I am shooting wildlife on a planned trip this summer.2.  The focusing system is more flexible than the D810 and more accurate. I especially love picking focus points on the rear touch screen -- so much easier than doing so using the buttons on the camera3.  Speaking of which... That rear screen. It is so clear and bright it pushes me to make more use of Live View, And about time Nikon offered a tilt screen. A great help when I was shooting the concert with the camera on a tripod. Last fall, I photographed the solar eclipse (from a park south of St. Louis. Camera on tripod, sun high in sky and I was lying in the dirt so I could keep an eye on the screen. With this camera, tilt the screen and that makes a difference for people my age. (I am old enough to have used a Nikon F when it was new.)4. The ergonomics -- a lot of people have commented on the deeper hand grip. A real positive for handheld. And the move of the ISO button makes a lot of sense.5.  Expeed 5 processing. Almost every time, I adjusted the exposure to override the processor in Greece (lots of bright backlighting in Greek ruins) I found the camera's exposure was superior to my correction. Heck, its tough to teach an old dog like me new tricks, but I respect that processor.6.  Overall speed. I avoided the D800 because I thought it was too slow for my needs. The D810 was acceptable. This is great -- I do like shooting wildlife6.  ISO 64.  Yes!!!! In that Greek sunshine I keep the ISO at 64 and the colors and resolution are just beautiful.Cons:1.  This camera is heavy. Its the first Nikon I have owned where it has felt heavy in my hands. Not a problem walking around with the camera on a BlackRapid strap, but a whole day of hand held shooting... not sure.  In Greece, we kept running into \"no photography allowed\" museums which is fine. But twice I elected to save weight by bringing a D610 body in the expectation that a museum would bar photos anyway. Both times, photos were allowed but shooting in a museum one does not need high pixel counts or speed.2.  The absence of the U1/U2 settings on the D610 -- easy to define personal settings. The Shooting Banks in the menu are not stable and not nearly as appealing.",

    "text": "I have now had the camera for a few days and wanted to give my initial thoughts on the D850. I am upgrading from the D810 and will give the review from this perspective. The overall feel is very similar with a few small changes. The grip feels thinner but deeper and most people find it more pleasant. FOr some reason I actually preferred the D810 grip. The D850 grip sort of has a square feeling in my hand.The button layout is a little different and overall I would say better. I prefer the ISO button on the right so you can make all major adjustments with the same hand. The joystick is much better for changing focus points. This could get annoying with the trackpad when you had to make larger focus point adjustments. The joystick makes this a quick process.I love the tiltscreen and what it allows me to do. I shoot a lot of landscape and I will no longer have to bend or lay down to get a shot. It also allows overhead shots that can really change perspective.The illuminated buttons are a welcomed addition. I shoot at night and its a nice option to have.Image quality is amazing. You can see the difference in detail compared to the D810. Its not a huge jump but noticeable. I also think ISO 64 is cleaner on the D850. When raising shadows the colors are truer and the detail is not lost.Some people have reported over a 1 stop gain in HIGH ISO. I don't believe this is true but I do think the D850 has cleaner High ISO shots. I do a lot of nightscapes and the D850 is definitely cleaner at ISO 3200- 6400. There is still noise to deal with but it is better. One area the D810 had issues with was hot pixels with long exposures. The D850 has greatly improved in this area. There is a few but it is much improved.Overall if you were happy with the image quality of the D810 or D750 you will not be disappointed with the D850. Don't expect a huge improvement because the D810 and D750 were already amazing with IQ.I haven't had a lot of chances to test the Auto focus system but I fully expect it to be tons better than the D810. I can say that the camera does a ton better focusing in lowlight. THe D810 struggled with this and I have yet to try and focus on something with the D850 and had it hunt for focus.Some other features I really enjoy:The focus stack feature has tons of potential. I have played with it a little and it really makes focus stacking a lot easier. I used it for a landscape scene but I am sure it will be great for macro.I love the focus peaking feature for stills. I use manual focus lenses and it really does change the success rate with fast manual lenses. I am so happy this feature has been added.The viewfinder is larger and looks nice but don't expect a huge difference. Its a small improvement.The silent mode will come in handy but it takes getting used to. I would stand there wondering if I just took a shot because its completely silent. This is mostly awkward when doing long exposures because you end up touching the camera to check while its still taking the photo.Overall the D850 is a definite winner and I think almost all buyers will be thrilled with it. If you plan to take advantage of the 7-9FPS I suggest investing in the XQD card.I do wish Nikon would make the custom buttons even more customizable. There is still a lot of restrictions that seem so easy to correct.",

    "text": "I've had this camera for a couple of months now and am really pleased with my decision to upgrade from the Nikon D810.Image quality is really not that different from my D810 but this camera does nail the white balance far more frequently than the D810 did. This saves me a lot of time in post processing.Where this camera really blows away the D810 is with the focus engine. Whether it's up to D5 levels or not, it is light years ahead of the D810. I set the D850 to AF-C with dynamic-area (25) focus and simply spray-shot as my two dogs ran around the yard near dusk. The results were shockingly good as the D850 continued to nail shot after shot. With my D810, a play session with the dogs might yield 5-10 usable shots out of several hundred taken. With the D850, I had well over 100 perfectly-focused shots of the frenetic dogs; this was without the benefit of direct sunlight. I shot those with my 85mm F1.4G at F1.4, ISO 1250, and 1/2000 shutter speed. Noise was really low (though visible when you zoom in to 100% view). Fortunately, the noise is fairly easy to clean up in post processing.The touchscreen is nice and I use it more than I thought I would. Scrolling/zooming an image is not as fast as a smartphone, but it's very good and not painfully laggy. The tilt screen (which tilts both upwards and downwards) is a great addition that lets you set the camera on the floor to capture a crawling baby without having to lay on your stomach.45MP is a lot of data. I shoot RAW and I learned this weekend that I can fill a 32GB card in a matter of minutes when doing action photography. For that reason, I moved to a 128GB card. I went with the Sony G UHS-II SD card and performance is magnificent. I considered a 128GB XQD, but I already had a good SD reader and at the time I needed them, XQD cards and readers were in short supply. Due to the extremely good performance of the Sony G UHS-II SD cards, I'm content to stick with SD even though I know XQD can be faster. Either way, 32GB (~300 shots) is not enough storage for this camera if you shoot RAW so plan on a large card.As a former owner of a D700 and then the D810, I can tell you that as an owner of either of those, you'll be thrilled with this camera. If you're still using the magnificent D700, be prepared for image handling to be drastically slower unless you've recently upgraded your computer. If you've already jumped to 36MP, then going to 45MP is not really a noticeable difference.",

    "text": "The Nikon Z 50 was listed in the description as being sold by Amazon with a week delivery timeframe. Within three hours of placing the order, I received an email that the camera was shipped from a dealer in NYC with one day delivery. Can\u2019t complain about that! But after reading the email more closely, I saw that it was listed as being\u2019Used, like new\u2019 condition with a one year dealer warranty. But the lenses were listed as being new. I rechecked the description and Nowhere was it listed as being a used or restored item, and it was being sold at the same price as other Z50 cameras, and nowhere was this dealer listed as being the seller.So either the description was deceptive, or Amazon transferred it out to the dealer.That being said, the camera arrived in a Nikon package with all required items, neatly packed except for the warranty card. If I hadn\u2019t read the email listing it as being used, I wouldn\u2019t have known the difference. The camera was in great shape, no scratches or blemishes, and works great. So was it a returned item, or just taken out of the box for a customer viewing, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m pleased with the camera and will keep it, but I\u2019m just upset that it was not listed as being sold used by a dealer, instead of being listed as being new from Amazon. So be aware that items delivered may not be as listed in the description.",

    "text": "I own the Nikon z50 and the Canon  EOS M6 V2.Many of you will want to know which is best..Let me talk about them briefly.The Canon M6V2 is a more evolved camera series as its now many incarnations into the series.  The M6V2, is the Flagship now, as it is taking the place of the M5.Its a nice Camera.  Its worth the money.  Photos are excellent. The feel of the camera is excellent. The build quality, the AF, the EVF, are all excellent. The screen is very good.  Its also a smaller and more compact camera then the Nikon Z50.I find the photos, as compared to the Nikon, are nearly identical, with the Canon's offering slightly more resolution if you pixel peep.  This is the effect of a 30+ Resolution sensor, vs, a 20+.The only thing i dont like about the Canon M6V2, is that you can't manually adjust the sharpness of the images. You can't do this inside the camera.  It will allow you to adjust the saturation, contrast, etc, but you can't adjust the sharpness.The Nikon Z50 is a fast fun experience.  The Jpeg IQ is awesome. The same style of  tilting screen is slightly larger then the Canon's.  The EVF is excellent.  The Kit lens is very sharp.  The body of the Nikon Z50 is metal but does not feel expensive. The Nikon has a wonderful front grip.  Auto focus is sure and fast.  Low Light shooting is very good.The battery door is horrible. No Spring.  The card slot is a bit frustrating to try to use when removing the card.You CAN adjust the Sharpness of the photos inside the camera.The photo i posted taken with the Nikon is \"P\" and pretty much Auto, with +1 Sharpness and +1 Contrast.The Nikon  when set to \"center point\" focus,  captures the entire frame as well as the focal point, better then the Canon.The Nikon does not allow you to change the focus point using the screen, while you look through the EVF.Both of these excellent cameras are fine shooters with world class IQ and color rendition,  and do not disappoint.",

For me the field includes the Nikon Z50, Panasonic GX9, Fujifilm X-T30, and Olympus E-M5 (all comparable in size, resolution, and features). I would highly recommend the Z50 to any first-time mirrorless user. Its pros include:+ Lens sharpness and image quality as good as or better than anything in the 20 megapixel range+ Great handling and beautiful viewfinder+ Lenses cover a big range with compact size and weight (definitely buy the kit with both lenses)+ Absolutely fantastic value for moneyI really, REALLY wanted the Z50 to work out for me but as an enthusiast I couldn't quite get over the lens selection. The two lenses in the kit are the only ones practical to use for at least a few years. There are no other Z DX lenses and the only one on the roadmap falls within the same range (no wide angle zoom or primes are planned). The Z50 has no in-body stabilization so other Z lenses won't benefit from stabilization, and using any other Nikon lens requires an adapter, increasing cost and bulk.When the Nikon Z DX offering matures -- maybe with a Z70 that includes stabilization -- I will eagerly consider it again in a few years.",

    "text": "The Z50 is small, nice and small, with good physical controls and frankly fantastic kit lenses. I hope and pray they give us a few fast Dx primes one day, but the 16-250 mm range of the 2 lenses, with very light weight and outstanding optics make me happy. I do like the fact that one mount will service Dx and Fx sensors, as it is with other mounts out there. I am at home with Nikon ergonomics, they make sense to me. Images are more than brilliant. I haven't felt this much satisfaction in a long time. Whatever they have done with this 20 Mpx sensor, they've done it right. Incredibly low noise and the airplane photo shown is a 50% crop. I am so happy that this all fits in my fanny pack as I walk around no one knows what's in it. The autofocus video, which i don't use much, is still better than I was able to get out of an a6400 - in continuous. Bottom line, this works, is very affordable, gives great image quality and I want MORE Dx .... More, do you hear Nikon, MORE Dx on Z mount.",

    "product_link": "/Lenovo-IdeaPad-Essential-Computer-Graphics/dp/B09RND1LP2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8",
    "text": "The model I received comes with a Ryzen 5 6600U, RTX 3050 4GB, 8GB of DDR5-4800 (I added another 8 gigs before doing much else so bear that in mind for performance reviews), and a 256 gig internal storage drive (I use an external 1TB SSD for games).Not a bad laptop overall. Had some issues but some were caused by Windows, not the laptop itself.If you're upgrading the RAM or storage, be extra sure to make sure Windows doesn't have any updates waiting. Windows 11 made the great decision to no longer tell users if their shutting down of a PC would also be applying updates. So unplugging the battery and adding more RAM unknowingly mid-update despite having shut down the laptop bricked my operating system and I had to reinstall. Downside is that you need ethernet upon a reinstall so you can download wifi drivers. Upside is it gets rid of the bloatware Lenovo tries preinstalling with the laptop.The inside is pretty simple, RAM is covered by a small metal tray with thermal pads on it for heat dissipation. A free M.2 storage slot is right in the open, ready for you to add storage as needed (you will need it). Thermals seem pretty solid, fans ramp up in gaming (I barely hear them over my headset which I don't run very loud and is an open-back headset, meaning I can hear noises outside of the headset fairly well) but rarely get too extreme.For gaming, it's a mixed bag. Needless to say, ray tracing will not be something you'll use on this laptop for playable frame rates. I doubt even 30 fps is achievable without dropping to 720p or less. Rainbow Six Siege was able to handle 1080p 120 fps consistently with mixed graphics settings (90 fov, ultra LOD, Medium textures and Shadows, most else set to low) with or without DLSS enabled. Though I did experience a bug where the render scaling option said I was running at ~850p even with the render scaling set to 100... an oddity to be sure. Halo Reach struggled to achieve similar results on Forge World, with bad tearing when the fps cap was set to 120. I lowered it to 60 and all was well, though drops may not be out of the question in high-intensity situations like custom games or campaign. Minecraft Java ran mostly above 60 fps on a modded server without Optifine or any other performance enhancers. Even in a particularly-taxing area it was mostly fine when the render distance was turned down. I'm sure with the use of Optifine or Sodium it'd be a very solid gaming experience.Windows 11 is a bit of a chore. Upon first installing Steam, I realized that my default Documents folder pinned to my Quick Access in the File Explorer was labeled under OneDrive. I never gave OneDrive permission to backup anything on my PC, as the measley 5 GB it gives you isn't enough for anything I would use a computer for. But it forces a backup, and deleting from the OneDrive cloud deletes it from your PC as well for... some insane reason. So be wary if you use Windows 11, make sure you remove the tabs from the Quick Access bar in File Explorer and replace them with the actual local file locations (Documents, Pictures, Music, etc).The keyboard is... weird. I've used mechanical and membrane alike in plenty of scenarios, but this one just feels weird compared to either. It's not unusable by any means but it takes getting used to. The trackpad is fine, I prefer having mouse buttons with my trackpad but it's not unusable even without them.The speakers are tinny. For 2W speakers it's not bad but it's not going to have the amazing sound quality the description would lead you to believe. Would suggest using headphones.The I/O is alright. Type-C with full DisplayPort functionality is nice to have, HDMI 2.0 is plenty for what this laptop is capable of, and the back-facing Ethernet and charging ports are quite handy in most situations. I've always been a fan of Lenovo's chargers as well, for some reason the reversible square shape just feels right. My only complaint would be a lack of USB ports, and the lack of SD/MicroSD. I know the latter is getting up there in age which makes it more a personal preference, but the former can make it difficult to use with numerous external devices (keyboard, mouse, storage, controllers, etc) since you are limited to 3 max only if you have type-C connectivity, otherwise you get two ports for peripherals and nothing more. An extra USB 2 port would have been nice to have.Overall it's a solid deal. Boot times are fast, gaming feels alright, the wifi signal is solid (though I did notice some lag while using a bluetooth Xbox Series controller with wifi, need to test and see if the lag is still present while using ethernet) and the laptop is easy to modify for basics like RAM and storage for the most part. A solid system from Lenovo.*Update 2/11/2023 - Found out that this laptop actually does support VRR via AMD Freesync. However, this is not listed anywhere the laptop can be found. I had to install AMD's graphics software in order to enable it, despite the laptop having an Nvidia GPU inside. This helped immensely with stuttery FPS in various games, though issues with Nvidia control panel's FPS limits caused other issues unrelated with the laptop itself.",

Small adjustments is needed right out of the box.- 256GB SSD/8GB RAM isn't suitable for modern games at all but it come with the cost of the laptop.- 720p Camera is just there to be used for a quick call video. And the Mic too.Downsides:- Battery life isn't great. Expect to get about 3-4 hours of basic use in \"Balanced\" mode and 4-5 hours in \"Quite\" mode if the screen brightness is 75%/Bluetooth is off and speakers is at 50% (Or headphones plugged in to bypass it). Expect the battery drain faster if you're playing a somewhat demanding game.- The fans can get LOUD when playing a demanding game!Overall:For $650, you can't go wrong with that deal (At that time). I wanted a laptop to kind of replaced my 8 year old desktop and my hand-me-down laptop that was 12 years old before I gave it to a friend of mine that really needed a PC for basic tasks. I had around a grand from my check and I just was looking to see if any deals at the time. And then this laptop came up and I said \"Why not? It looks decent enough to have andto upgrade.\" And here we are. I even added 32GB DDR5/2TB Storage upgrade ASAP that cost me nearly $300 alone, putting the cost close to the entire check I have, and do I regret it? Nah. It's exactly what I wanted. There are some flaws with this laptop but at the price that I paid for it's outweigh the cons, but I do recommend getting the ideapad series on a sale because it's a hell of a deal if you are planning to keep the laptop for years on end like me. It's been about 3 months and so far I am loving my new laptop!But sadly the model I have currently (3050, R5-6600H) is getting replace by the newer and more expensive model that have a 4050, R7-7735HS which IS a better laptop via hardware but it's going to be a while for a good sale to happen for the 4050 version. Again, if you're really looking to get a decent modern gaming laptop look at this laptop at least before it's truly gone.",

    "text": "Why does the 3.5mm jack on a laptop produce better better clarity, soundstage, and imaging than my dedicated hifi dac did... I just wanted to point out something nobody else is talking about.Gaming - Better than expectedTemps - GoodFans - Mid-volume. Almost all laptops you'll have to deal with small, shrill fans. This is no exception, but I'd rate them slightly above average from my samples. A cooling pad with larger, quieter fans caused the laptop fans to go down way low. Responds well to cooling pad, as most laptops do.Keyboard - Top-notch. Very satisfying to type on. Clickety clickety click.Touchpad - Once you get used to the fact that your single-taps can't be feather-light, I think everything else about it is good. However, I can say that.. Sometimes I'll single tap and it won't do anything. But I have skinny fingers. And it's cold?Screen Brightness - It's medium, it's not very bright like people say. Also I've tried several of the power saving tweaks, mine never changed, maybe yours will.I'll come back as I continue to use this. Been a week.Standout - Surprisingly good quality from the 3.5mm jack. Perhaps audiophile quality, I will keep tweaking stuff and see how good I can get it to sound. But so far, very clear. Soundstage out of the gate seemed more deep than wide. May need a little boost around the 500hz area for my liking. String guitars sounded phenomenally realistic. Center image for me was very good. Using an old Sherwood Newcastle 963t amp, sony sscs5 stereo speakers with a very slightly included yamaha sub. I don't like overpowering bass. I was hearing far more detail from this soundcard than my Xonar DG \"hifi\" 192khz desktop card. Also better than both my Sherwood and Onkyo receiver's DACs. This is a big thing for me because along with portability I wanted to make sure I didn't lose my hifi. I was prepared to go DAC-hopping after selling my desktop for this laptop. Because why would a gaming laptop have ideal sound for hifi music?Well, so far it's beating my other dedicated hifi dac only on its 3.5 so, I might just keep it like this lol. I will try other DACS eventually and see if there's anything going on there. But this onboard sound is more clear than my dedicated DAC. I will see if I can get instruments to sound like real instruments. Cello didn't quite hit that buttery sound that I like, that's why I may boost the 500hz or so. But the highs sounded refined, very pinpoint accurate and tickly. Bongos sounded very poppy and in-room. High strings like banjo and guitar sound spot on. Mid-bass clarity was awesome, and actually now had location. My old DAC didn't really place some of those lower sounding instruments at all.The purpose of this review was to give you another bonus that you may not have considered. Read other reviews for more on gaming and other features but for audio I am highly enjoying it. I think it definitely upped my hifi listening. Which I was not expecting at all. Awesome laptop on all points for me so far. Ask around, maybe I just got a magic pairing of equipment but I think it's very good for what it is.",

    "text": "I've had this Lenovo ideapad gaming 3 Ryzen 5 6600h rtx 3050 version with 8gb ddr5 ram & 256gb ssd for about a month now and so far the performance has been spectacular. There are a couple irritations rather then cons ill get into shortly. I was hesitant not knowing if this setup would run the games I play at the highest resolutions and frame rate this PC offers.This laptop has been flawless at running call of duty MW 2(2009), COD black Ops and GTA 5 on the highest settings with out any hiccups, choppy video, freezing etc. For me it has been lightning fast and silky smooth. Yes there are higher frame rates out there but the costs are astronomic for what little upgrades you get.I love the fact I haven't found any bloatware in this PC. Although not recommended by Lenovo it does allow overclocking. It stays cool even with heavy gameplay for hours on end. The fans work great at dispersing heat and are not so loud you get distracted while gaming. When just casually running browsers or streaming the fans never kick on it just stays cool enough to not need them.I've read users think its not sturdy enough? I think its very sturdy. The keyboard doesn't flex while pushing keys and its quite hefty. The screen doesn't feel wobbly or weak. Its not made of aluminum like an Asus tuf f15 but it does the job well.Other users say the brightness and colors are dim but that has not been the case for me. Its not 4k but I had to turn the brightness down. The colors are great for me. If you are a professional photo editor or video editor just get an external monitor. You shouldn't be editing professional work on a 15.6\" screen anyway haha its a gaming laptop not a photo/video workstation.  You'll need more power to render huge files.The only cons/ irritations-256gb ssd is just an outdated size for storage. GTA 5 alone is 142gb. Yes it can be upgraded but at least a 512gb should be standard. Crucial says it will support 2tb but I have not personally added that size. I will definitely be upgrading to at least 1tb.8gb ram has worked flawlessly with the aforementioned games I have installed. But it would have been nice to see a standard 16gb (2\u00d78gb ddr5) cards installed. I will be upgrading to 32gb ddr5 2x16gb cards just because. The price jump for 16gb factory is crazy! Upgrading to 16gb costs like 40 bucks verses a $200 price jump for 16gb pre installed.So far I have not found any other cons to this system. I love it and am very happy with its performance and price. I don't think you'll find a better laptop at this price for gaming.Note I do have lightroom installed and it runs flawless. But its just for casual photo editing.I couldn't be happier. A+ purchase.",

    "text": "Ok to make this quick and sweet and since I'm not very good at making reviews I'll start with the good and then end with the issues at least I've experienced with mine in the past few days I've had it and been using it.The laptop is actually pretty good at playing about anything I throw at it even if it is over the specs like resident evil village at absolute maximum settings with ray tracing on with the laptop only on balanced mode. I still got about 30-50 frames even with the settings at max. It also can handle the new dead space remake quite well. the laptop is quite responsive as well and never really got too hot even when being stressed I rarely heard the fans kick up like my more expensive MSI ge66 raider. Now for the issues I've had with mine, when I first got mine I had a issue where playing videos weather it was in Microsoft edge/Chrome on YouTube or local videos it would cause the whole display to glitch in a glitchy pattern, flash to black like windows had crashed and then reopened everything, lock up the video playback at one frame with audio still playing then suddenly zoom the video to where it should be, or flicker between two frames with audio and time still going then suddenly zoom forward to where the video should be at. I did reinstall the Nvidia and AMD drivers but it still persisted which is where the second issue happened even though I think this was more to do with windows but the visual c++ 2015 - 2022 redistributable wouldn't install because I think there was a issue with visual c++ 2015 - 2019 redistributable not wanting to update or even letting me uninstall it like it didn't exist even though it was there. To fix that I had to reinstall windows 11 using windows reset with the option to keep my personal files selected where my 3rd issue came up but fixed itself I guess after a full system shutdown for hours. After the reset the Lenovo ACPI disappeared and so did the power modes and other parts of the Lenovo Vantage side bar options so I couldn't use quick charge or conservation mode even after manually installing the Lenovo ACPI it didn't come back or show in device manager only seeing the Microsoft ACPI. I even tried reinstalling Lenovo vantage and it's services but that didn't work. To fix that I uninstalled the Microsoft ACPI then installed the Lenovo ACPI then shut down my laptop for like 5-6 hours. After all that even though it still shows Microsoft ACPI in device manager the Lenovo vantage settings came back. The final issue which goes back to the video playback issue. I think I found the solution along with reinstalling the drivers you have to disable \"Use Hardware Acceleration When Available\" setting in chrome seems to have fixed that issue from what I know of as of making this review. But there's another issue from that which happened at least once when I turned that setting back on and watched a video as soon as I started up the video the feedback froze and then suddenly the whole display went completely black even the backlight and then my system suddenly restarted. In event viewer it said it was from Kernel-Power with event ID:41. Not exactly sure what to make of that but it appeared in the event viewer as a critical error at the same time the system crashed and restarted from the video.So in summery this laptop is great for everyday gaming if you're not expecting extreme power. It will get you by with the current specs if you want a budget entry level gaming laptop but there might be issues in some areas unless I got a little faulty system. I'm thinking the issues I've had with video playback are drivers causing problems I'll keep a eye on it and see if more problems come up while using it more.",

    "text": "When I first got this laptop, it had everything I needed. Able to run games medium to high graphics and perfect as a university student along with multitasking. Normally I would clean the inside and outside of the laptop once every month since it doesn't get dusty that often and the laptop runs cool even after 7 months, with the highest temps being 73'C for both the CPU and GPU.Now, the problem is the black screen of death. I checked for everything; made sure the ram was seated properly, disconnected the CMOS battery to reset the BIOS settings (even though I didn't update it), checked to see if it was my external monitor or HDMI cable (since I use an external monitor), I always shutdown my computer before either going to sleep or going on the road, tried running it without the battery and NOTHING. The laptop is still working fine, the fans spin and the keyboard still lights up but only the screen died. I followed every possible known solution on the net that fixes it but unfortunately none have worked for me and it seems that my entire screen has just stopped working abruptly (it was working perfectly fine the other night with no flickers).I would've rate 5 stars but to see this happen to a very respectable and reliable laptop and it hasn't even been a year or two since I got it, is sadly disappointing.",

    "text": "Purchased the Ideapad Flex 5 16\" R7-512GB laptop version while it was on sale on Prime Day for $699. So far I am overall happy with this unit. The screen quality is very good for a lower to mid budget laptop and colors are vibrant enough. Touchscreen works great as well. I like the idea of the flexibility of changing between laptop mode and tablet mode. The 16\" screen size in tablet mode is great for watching movies and other random entertaining things, but if your goal is to use it for note taking or similar, it is a little on the larger side and would recommend the 14\" instead.  My main purpose is to use it for travels and remote work via remote desktop, so the additional real estate on the screen was important for me for my engineering work (CAD and programming).Since I also have a need for multiple monitors when stationary, I went ahead and also purchased a cheap off-brand USB-C docking station from Falwedi on Amazon. I was able to expand to at least 2 additional monitors, resulting in a triple monitor setup, one 24\" Dell 1080 and another 27\" Dell 2K. I did however get some issues where the external monitors would blank for a second or two occasionally, but not yet sure if this was due to the current drivers on the Ideapad or the off-brand docking station. Something I will need to investigate further at a later time.Sound quality from the speakers is just ok. There is no base, which I wouldn't expect from a lower budget laptop anyways. The camera worked decently and clear, which is sufficient for most video conferences anyways.The fingerprint reader works flawlessly and makes login into Windows and other biometric supporting apps super easy.I am however surprised on how heavy this unit is for being a new modern 16\" model. Reminds me of my 10+ year old Toshiba brick. Another drawback is that the pen or stylus was not included with it and is sold separately.There is no ethernet port and for those that want to utilize wired connections, will need to purchase an additional dongle.",

Excelent definition BUT a little bit reflective and perhaps need a little bit more NITS if you think to use outside.6) The model that I've choosed it's toooo heavy but, I selected a 16\" because this one it's not gonna be my mobile laptop7) The HD Camera is soso, I have a Dell Latitude 9000 series too for work and the diference between this HD (works like 380 and not 720p) It's a lot vs the 1080p Camera of the Latitude. BUT this was not important for me8) USC C work awesome. I've and external extreme SSD and works at 700MB/s I was impressive about that.9) The keyboard and touchpad feeling are ok.So...

But I don\u2019t know where the power went to. I charge it to 100% and then shut it down and then the next day when I turned it on it was at 50%. It said I had 1 hour and 27 minutes left to the battery life. And I didn\u2019t do anything overnight with, so I\u2019m questioning where the power went to? So as I said, it has a fingerprint reader, but every time I turn it on spin, asking me to enter a pin number or password. If I have a fingerprint reader, that should be one of the options initially. I did set it up with my fingerprint before going through all that other things about the password. It\u2019s a good enough computer. It just has some quirks. And all the time is asking me to put in a McAfee subscription or to buy one. I can\u2019t tell you how many fake emails I get every day about some McAfee subscription or some Norton thing I don\u2019t really know who to trust.  So that\u2019s kind of annoying.

The trouble began with a failure to charge/ boot (a common occurrence according to online reviews). I sent the unit with a 1TB SSD that was upgraded by this Amazon seller to The Depot in Houston. To my dismay, it was returned to me with a new motherboard and no SSD or harddrive. I returned it to The Depot and they returned it with the standard 256GB SSD. Lenovo refuses to return or replace the 1TB SSD because they claim it is not an original part and it is not covered under the warranty. I contacted the Amazon seller but they have not responded.Upon receiving unit the second time from the Depot the unit was still unusable because the operating system was removed. Lenovo offered to send a replacement unit with the standard specifications (not with a 1TB SSD or upgraded RAM). However, I declined because I did not want to have a standard model after having paid for an upgraded model. Several technician visits, numerous emails, and phone calls later, I was able to upload the OS. I am able to use the ThinkPad with a fraction of the memory I purchased from Amazon.To add to this, Lenovo claims the Premier Service warranty I purchased 24 months ago is for the replacement unit I never received, not my original product. This whole experience has been nothing but trouble. I will never purchase a Lenovo product again in my life.",

    "text": "For the last 10 months, I have had nothing but problems from my ThinkPad and Lenovo's customer service. The trouble began with a failure to charge/ boot (a common occurrence according to online reviews). I sent the unit with a 1TB SSD that was upgraded by this Amazon seller to The Depot in Houston. To my dismay, it was returned to me with a new motherboard and no SSD or harddrive. I returned it to The Depot and they returned it with the standard 256GB SSD. Lenovo refuses to return or replace the 1TB SSD because they claim it is not an original part and it is not covered under the warranty. I contacted the Amazon seller but they have not responded.Upon receiving unit the second time from the Depot the unit was still unusable because the operating system was removed. Lenovo offered to send a replacement unit with the standard specifications (not with a 1TB SSD or upgraded RAM). However, I declined because I did not want to have a standard model after having paid for an upgraded model. Several technician visits, numerous emails, and phone calls later, I was able to upload the OS. I am able to use the ThinkPad with a fraction of the memory I purchased from Amazon.To add to this, Lenovo claims the Premier Service warranty I purchased 24 months ago is for the replacement unit I never received, not my original product. This whole experience has been nothing but trouble. I will never purchase a Lenovo product again in my life.",

    "text": "For the last 10 months, I have had nothing but problems from my ThinkPad and Lenovo's customer service. The trouble began with a failure to charge/ boot (a common occurrence according to online reviews). I sent the unit with a 1TB SSD that was upgraded by this Amazon seller to The Depot in Houston. To my dismay, it was returned to me with a new motherboard and no SSD or harddrive. I returned it to The Depot and they returned it with the standard 256GB SSD. Lenovo refuses to return or replace the 1TB SSD because they claim it is not an original part and it is not covered under the warranty. I contacted the Amazon seller but they have not responded.Upon receiving unit the second time from the Depot the unit was still unusable because the operating system was removed. Lenovo offered to send a replacement unit with the standard specifications (not with a 1TB SSD or upgraded RAM). However, I declined because I did not want to have a standard model after having paid for an upgraded model. Several technician visits, numerous emails, and phone calls later, I was able to upload the OS. I am able to use the ThinkPad with a fraction of the memory I purchased from Amazon.To add to this, Lenovo claims the Premier Service warranty I purchased 24 months ago is for the replacement unit I never received, not my original product. This whole experience has been nothing but trouble. I will never purchase a Lenovo product again in my life.",

Otherwise, I would never have been able to bypass all of the hurdles that Microsoft has built into their system. No -- I DO NOT want a Microsoft account nor do I want to give them free passage to my data. Secondly, there are many programs and apps that are not beholden to Microsoft. Finding a way around their restrictions was a nightmare. If I had not had another computer, I don't think that I could have been successful in getting her machine going. Once I got everything in place, we have no complaints. The speed of the laptop is awesome. One suggestion: unless you go into the startup menu and deactivate the McAfee app, you will receive MANY alerts that tries to get you to purchase their software, and, these pop-ups are all but impossible to work around. Otherwise, Great Value for the Price!",

I cried when I got it and it felt like home. It's quiet. Quiet!!!!! I never hear the fan. I can do my computer art on it. I have no problems with photoshop and painter. I have 3d Blender on it but haven't used it yet. I shouldn't have a problem with it rendering on Eevee with it.I have used it in multiple rooms with different lighting.I love the touch screen. I can use the hp tilt pen on the screen but there is no pressure nor tilt to it. After researching I found HP has been blaming windows for 4 plus years and not fixed their drivers for the pen. So the pen gets 1 star. I was so excited to use the angle and pressure brushes with it and it works just as well as my finger. In photoshop and painter, the tilt pen will leave random dots flying around the art work. If pressing too light it will not draw or will skip. I have to hold screen in place with one arm and draw with the other to get enough pressure for the pen. I connected my old Wacom intuos tablet to it and it works like a dream with it. Image is a quick test with the same brushes used top and bottom- HP Tilt Pen on the laptop screen and Wacom Intuos pen on the wacom tablet.It plays music beautifully. Have watched some movies, played a few low quality games.I am still in the puttering stage getting use to using my laptop and I am so glad I bought it.Notes. When folded so screen is facing you and keyboard is behind. Make sure back vent gets air flow. Don't charge laptop in the case it comes with. Plugging in charger may turn it on and fan needs air.

I\u2019ve had the machine 3 weeks and really can\u2019t use it without this issue poking its head out so often it\u2019s unusable. I really wish they\u2019d just send me a replacement machine at this point it\u2019s clearly faulty even after motherboard replaced, monitor replaced, fans and heat sink replaced, and have reset the system with clean install. C\u2019mon Dell just own the issue of a faulty machine at this point and do right by the customer*First and foremost this thing is powerful. Beautiful display quality, and the design looks slick. That being said its not perfect but a machine this powerful you will expect some setbacks. She gets hot, so get a laptop pad that allows air to flow under more is a must, ones with fans will work a touch better. Just make sure its vented and not a flat surface, it makes a difference. The speakers do suck but who games with laptop speakers anyway?One thing to note is the white glove service you get from dell. My machine had a heating issue due to faulty cooling parts. Dell was absolutely helpful and sending a tech to my home to repair it onsite. You dont get that service many places at all. For that alone its a 5 star machine. 10/10 would recommend this if its in your budget and you need the power.",

    "text": "Extremely disappointed in Dell for the quality of this machine. The computer is defective and dangerous.Last week I purchased the computer brand new and it arrived in sealed box in \u201cperfect\u201d condition. Booted up with no issues and I proceeded to update with necessary drivers and software. A few hours later I go to turn off the computer and I pick up the power adapter and burn myself. Could not pick the adapter for about a half hour as it was much too hot to touch. Thought this was strange.The next day I boot up the computer again to see what happens to the power adapter. I do some light gaming for a few hours (all in-game graphics settings were set as default and profile of the graphics card was set to balanced with no over clocking). I finish and turn off the computer and again the power adapter is way too hot to touch. I then go to move the computer and touch the area above the function keys and subsequently burn myself again. What is going on\u2026The third day is testing day. Armed with a digital infrared thermometer, I now have the tools to see how hot things are getting. Before booting up I scan the surface of the power adapter and area around the keyboard. All check out fine around room temperature ~72 degrees. I then boot up and repeat the same process as the previous day and after an hour I test. The surface of the power adapter (located unobstructed on the floor, no clutter around it) checks in at 150 degrees, and the backside on the floor checks in even hotter. Next I test around the surface of the computer (the entire unit including the fans and vents are unobstructed with the closet obstruction several feet away). The area above the function keys checks in over 140 degrees. Areas on the sides and corners above the fans check in around 120-130 degrees. The keyboard itself is over 110. Not good.The next day things take a drastic turn. After the tests of the previous day I shutdown the computer but this time I left the power adapter plugged into the wall and plugged into the computer overnight (previously I had been disconnecting these). I attempt to turn on the computer but it does not turn on. I then touch the keyboard and surface and am surprised as it is very warm, and the power adapter is also very warm. Further testing reveals the power adapter to be over 100 degrees and the area above the keyboard to be over 120 degrees. So now not only does the computer not boot, but it is also heating up to unacceptable levels when it is shutdown and plugged in. Further, after unplugging the power adapter to the shutdown computer and waiting 30 minutes, the unit still remains hot with surfaces over 120 degrees in some places.After evaluating all of the evidence (the two burns on my hands, the temperature readings, the computer settings, and the failure to boot) my verdict is that this machine is defective and dangerous. Burning oneself is bad enough, but this unit has the potential to cause far more damage. I do not feel comfortable keeping this machine inside my house and potentially putting the lives of my family at risk as I have no doubt that this computer is a dangerous fire hazard.I paid thousands of dollars for this computer and am extremely disappointed and frustrated that Dell would produce such a poor quality and dangerous product. I will be attempting to return/exchange this unit and luckily I am covered under the return grace period and manufacturers warranty. I also purchased the extended warranty as well and would recommend this to anyone making a purchase like this. Buyer Beware.",

It's not heavy to carry and the color and build quality are outstanding. The phone is speedy enough to be functional including the cameras. The communication is loud and clear with no interruptions in conversations. Easy to connect to internet and the navigation is great. You can even play lite games like Sudoku with no problems. Listening your tones with Spotify and Bluetooth connected earbuds is very enjoyable. It has a big battery with the convenience of 10w fast charging that makes it a breeze. So for the money you get a nice phone with all the conveniences of the latest technology that won't let you down.",

The phone isn\u2019t that fast and thats alright considering the price point but not the speaker has completely gone silent. Just needed this phone as an extra and a decoy while being in Mexico so i could hide my iPhone, but still did want this phone to work in all aspects. Everything was fine and the speaker did work when i first started using it but for whatever reason i started watching a video on YouTube and about 20 min in it just went silent. I tried restarting the phone, going into recovery mode, messed around with all the settings, and even resetting the phone but to no avail. The top speaker when you get calls does still work its just the bottom one that doesnt. Camera quality on it also sucks bad.",

    "text": "This is an inexpensive Android phone and assessing it should reflect that fact. If you take that perspective then this phone merits the four stars I'm giving it here. It is not nor does its makers claim it to be a premium product, but those who want premium performance should cough up the premium price for it. For the hundred bucks you do pay for this phone you get your money's worth, and a bit more. It's reliable, sturdy, and has the essentials you should expect for calls, on-line access, texting, and running most apps. The camera is not great and while I'm not much of a gamer, I don't expect that it would run the latest games with great efficiency. But this is a device I'd get for someone who wants basic Android functionality and is not interested in paying for all the bells and whistles of high-end brands. It's fine for less tech-centric people, and if you have a kid who wants a phone that handles the fastest games and demanding video, give him or her the hundred bucks that this one costs and tell them to go get an after-school job or solicit odd jobs for neighbors to raise the extra five, six, nine hundred or more dollars to get it. This one, however, is more than adequate for the basics.",

I had dropped the phone numerous times due to being clumsy and it continued to work despite this with only the provided case as protection. In addition to this, you can download apps and use the phone without any real issues.I will note that at times the Bluetooth connection was spotty and I did have difficulty connecting Bluetooth devices to the phone. However, given the price this was a sacrifice I was willing to make.The camera quality is lower than average, however, again pretty good considering the cost of the phone.Overall, I think this is a good phone that will likely last at least a few months or year with the proper protection (case and screen protector).",

    "text": "The picture is nice.  Sound is good too.  The TV doesn\u2019t like it when it gets turned off while in an app.  It also doesn\u2019t like it if you try to go to the Home Screen by using the home button while in an app.  It prefers that you use the back button. Using the back button takes many seconds longer for every step you back up from.  If you turn the power off or press the home button the TV will freeze.  By this I mean that you can scroll up and down on the Home Screen but when you try to select an app or any other option, the screen will freeze. The remedy is to unplug the tv and plug it in again. Besides that, I also have the Hisense sound bar.  The odd thing is that there is no volume indicator on the screen when using the sound bar.  The volume indicator shows on the screen only when you\u2019re using the tv speakers and not the connected sound bar.  So you don\u2019t have an idea of how loud it is when using the sound bar other than what you hear. The price is right though. If you\u2019re going to have these issues, better on this than a higher priced tv.",

They are easy to trim and I used 1 1/2 sheets per shelf.  My refrigerator now looks like Easter with the pastel colors.  It is very nice.  The liners wipe clean and I don't need to remove the entire shelf to get it cleaned off.  The one thing I don't really like is they are not non-slip. They would not stay put so I had to tape each one down with a velcro to make it stick.  It worked, but I shouldn't have needed to do that.  It could be just my glass shelves making it slide, but I adjusted.  Overall, I am happy with this and like the way my refrigerator looks.  These sheets should last quite a while as they seem durable enough for everyday use.  I just think either a double sided tape should be included, or maybe a little stickier surface on the face-down side.",

    "text": "These are sturdy liners. I bought them for my refrigerator. The one thing I have with other liners, not used in the frig, is that they move around if there is no adhesive on the back. This has always irritated me! I wanted something that would stay in place when I was pulling something out of the frig. So far they seem to do the trick. They are easy to remove, wash, and replace. I did not cut to size. My refrigerator needs one whole one and about 3/4 of a second one. So I just decided to overlap them to see how that did. So far so good.The only issue I have with them so far is that they are shipped in a long rectangular box rolled up. This causes them to have bends in them and they do not lay flat. I did not even think about that when I received them so when I got them, I cleaned out the frig and then got the liners out. I had to put heavy stuff where the liners didn't lay flat. So, when you get them, get them out first and flatten them!! Then go about your business!! I will update if my opinion of them changes!",

I didn't need to cut any of these; in fact, I could have used some with a little more width because even two on one shelf left about a three inch gap. They are nice liners that were easy to lay down on each shelf, and in the freezer too, and I like the bright pastel colors. I know they'll be easy to wash, either by wiping them down while in the fridge or in the sink if a good scrubbing is needed. What I also really like about these mats is that they don't have a odd odor, something I am always concerned about when buying anything made from plastic or vinyl. They seem durable, and I know I'll get a lot of use out of them!",

    "text": "Ten minutes in I was *certain* I must have missed some major prior movies, because there were all these references & characters that I had no idea about, but yet were clearly supposed to mean something to me (lots of ominous pauses & slow-motion, as if I'm supposed to gasp and say \"oh no!  not him again!\").  Maybe if you're well-versed in the comics, this all makes sense?Turns out I hadn't missed any of the previous movies, it's just this movie starts out very rough.  The plot itself is easy to follow, though, so it wasn't too hard to just go with it, and by the end it comes together reasonably well.  I'm still confused about why I was clearly supposed to know a bunch of backstory that hasn't been covered in any prior MCU movies, but, oh well\u2026As for what it is\u2026 it's enjoyable.  It felt kind of like a big episode of Agents of Shield.  It's more \"human\" in some respects than most of the other MCU movies, and there's even some self-deprecating, self-aware humour in places to that affect.  Agent Romanoff is only human, after all.It's hard to detail some of my favourite aspects without spoilers\u2026 suffice to say that one of the new characters, tied to Black Widow, was a surprising hit for me.  Very well played, with great dialog that really embodied the tone of the movie.Some part of it didn't do it for me, though.  I can't put my finger on it.  Maybe it's just that after dozens of MCU movies it's feeling a bit samey?  I dunno.  It's an above-average MCU movie, but there's no risk of it displacing my top favourites.",

    "text": "I will start this review off by saying these are not my best sounding headphones.  My Beyerdynamic Aventho and Audeze Penrose sound better in almost every way.  In fact, my cursed Drop Panda that no longer even turn on might even sound better and I do not like how they sound wired because I remember how good they sounded wireless when tuned to my hearing preferences.  But that's not really why I love these headphones so much.To be fair, they don't sound bad at all.  But I bought them for a completely different reason than any of the aforementioned headphones.  I bought these for their 2.4Ghz wireless feature as the words \"lossless\" and \"low-latency\" are really what sold this for me.  I wanted a pair of headphones for monitoring and general studio use to replace my missing Sennheiser HD280.  But I liked the idea of being able to play my keyboard and digital piano without being tied down by wires or monitoring my microphones for work calls without having wires sprawled all over my desk.  In fact, the idea of being able to just listen to music wirelessly but without the latency and hassle of bluetooth was calling me.The biggest disadvantage to these headphones in my mind is not how they sound - as I said before, these aren't my best sounding headphones.  No, the worst feature is the hiss you get when you use them over 2.4GHz.  You can mediate this a bit by turning down the volume on the headphones themselves and raising it at the source, but these aren't the loudest/easiest to drive headphones, so you could find yourself nearly maxing out volume depending on the device and audio program/app you're listening to.  In most cases, I've just learned to live with the hiss because not having the wire is more important in the situation where I choose to use this headphone over 2.4Ghz.  (btw, the Avantree Audiplex 2403 is an option for enjoying wireless 2.4Ghz audio with much less hiss but also with the slight hassle of an additional dongle and cable involved - I did a review of that as well; it's pretty great for what it is).  When you want freedom from wires, having \"lossless\" and \"low-latency\" wireless freedom is just great.  2.4Ghz is so much better than even AptX LL.My second reason for loving these headphones is how comfortable they are for my small head.  Because I have very short hair and a relatively small lady-head, most headphones don't fit me well even at their smallest headband setting.  I usually have to go with on-ear options like the aforementioned Aventho or my beloved Marshall Mid ANC because they fit me.  But over-ear is still more comfortable than on-ear and these headphones with their Alcantara earcups fit me better and are more comfortable for me than any other pair over over-ear headphones I currently own.  So I reach for these even though my Penrose sounds better and is also wireless via 2.4Ghz dongle. I reach for it over my Bluetooth headhones and wired/wirelss earphones.And that brings me to the next thing I love about these headphones.  Because Aiaiai makes so many pieces for these headphones, they can kinda be whatever you want them to be.  I picked up the USB-C cable (which I had to import from Europe at a stupid price, sigh), and the straight 3.5mm cable (direct from Aiaiai).  When I'm in a situation where I don't need the wireless freedom, I can plug the headphones into one of my Android devices via the USB-C cable, or I can even plug in the 3.5mm cable into one of my USB DACs or my Sony DAP.  I love the flexibility this system offers me and I love the idea that if there's an upgrade to the wireless system, I can swap out the headband and transmitter someday (hopefully for one with less hiss).  If the earcups wear out, I can replace them.  And if the company comes out with improved drivers, I can upgrade that as well.  I would buy these headphones again in a heartbeat if something happened to them.BTW - I haven't seen any reviews anywhere comparing these to the new Rode NTH-100.  My husband, who is a drummer and budding DJ, just picked up a pair for his own monitoring purposes.  They are very similar in sound and if you have small ears, similar in comfort.  I find that my ears are just large enough that I feel the earcups on the Rode (probably again because of the position of the cups on my small head) and while that isn't annoying, I do know from reading reviews that this annoys some people.  There is an audible difference in the midrange (~300-400hz) between the two as the Rode has a slight bump in almost the exact place where the TMA-2 has a slight dip and there is more presence in the very high-end on the TMA-2 as well.  But in general, it's not a stark difference for most situations and for listening to music it wasn't an issue for me.  But if you're using either set for recording or mixing, you do need to be aware of the frequency response for each in case you need to compensate for how you want the audio to sound vs. what you're hearing.  This is true of anything that isn't perfectly flat, though, and neither headphone is perfectly flat.  But I didn't come away listening to his headphones and feeling bad about my purchase.Right now, there is nothing else out there quite like these headphones and for that reason alone, I think these are worth a look for anyone looking for the flexibility and future expandability this pair offers.",

Its not fancy enough to use a special case for it which means you can just throw it in your backpack anytime.- Packaging and ease of assembly- I would rate the comfort level as adequate. I wouldn't want to wear this more than 4 hours straightCons- The noise, it is BAD.- The noise level is no longer audible if the volume is below 50%- Battery life could be better- Sound quality. I did not like the sound signature but appreciate that its accurate. It feels dark.",

So then went back to wired headphones. When searching for a fix for the delay problem I found someone who did a positive review of the TMA-2 Studio Wireless+. Ordered them and got them in three days expecting to return them. But no, they are great.  The headphones work perfect, the sound is good and now I get more work done comfortably. Have wires hanging down can pull things off the mount or desk. They come disassembled neatly package that takes 2 minutes to put together. As you assemble them you will understand the engineering quality. This company made these to be taken apart to replace anything that could get damaged in time so you can replace just that part. Yes, they have parts listed that you can buy. The build quality is of the highest standard and shows that it's about the customer and not just making a profit. Battery life is great. I will buy the next generation that they come out with. They say you can trade up, but I think I would keep the old set too.",

However, the W+ link can be glitchy at times (e.g., randomly disconnecting and reconnecting) and there is white noise. I personally don't mind the white noise, even for music production/monitoring. The sound is very balanced/flat, and comparable to the Audio-Technica ATH-M50X.As well, I had some manufacturing defect on some of the parts (e.g., screws not attached properly on headband and some left over plastic on the ear-cups).But my big issue with this product is not the product itself, but my experience with Amazon customer service. Two agents, on different days, promised that I'd received a partial refund and that could keep the headphones because of the manufacturing defects. However, a week after this solution was promised to me, an Amazon Leadership manager nullified the offer. And now I'm stuck with a great item with minor defects and a lack in trust with Amazon's promises.Anyways, bottom line, if you want/need studio wireless headphones for music production, monitoring and/or DJing look no further than the AIAIAI TMA-2 Studio Wireless+.",

I can still hear my audio the whole time, with the volume reduced while this is happening. I contacted support about it and they said it will be fixed in a future firmware update. I'll update my review if/when that happens.I also hate that I have to hold down the power button for 5 seconds to turn the headphones on, and 3 seconds for the transmitter. It's just long enough to be annoying, and somehow the timing being different makes it feel more awkward.They're not my best-sounding headphones, nor my most comfortable headphones, and yes there is a noticeable background hiss when using the low latency wireless.

You see, usually wireless headphones are using bluetooth protocol and that often adds a very perceivable latency, making it impossible to use when playing an instrument.Unfortunately they didn't live up to the expectations. The latency in 2.4GHz mode is just fine, but everything else was not.Being positioned as \"Studio\" headphones targeted at \"Music Creators\" I expected them to produce a clear crisp sound. Not too loud, no bass boost, usually present on many consumer headphones, but plain clear, flat, even sound. Unfortunately this was not even remotely the case. While the bass does sound kind of OKish, everything above that is a muddy mess. I couldn't believe the difference between these and a pair of cheapo wired studio monitor headphones I have, for like 1/10 of the price of these. The cheapo ones deliver ten times the sound fidelity.The muddy sound persists in all modes of operation, be it 2.4GHz, Bluetooth or wired.I'm returning them.",

Ok, well I needed a TV with no \"smart\" capabilities---I just needed a basic flat screen TV (for a bedroom) which was fresh on the shelf with a low price tag. This one hit that mark. The picture is not horrible but it's also not spectacular either (better than some, not as great as many others.) Besides the attached power cable (I prefer the power cable to have its own designated port in), and its annoyingly shrill & raspy sound, this TV hit all my marks! Actually what's more important to me about a flat TV is connectivity & this model offered far more than most @ 720p/60hz. 3 HDMIs (in)[1 of which is ARC---it can interfere with the performance of the other HDMIs *and is also not eARC* so this contributed to the loss of 1 star], PC(w/ a PC sound port), fiberoptic digital audio (out), and (the piece of resistance) a superb grandfinal\u00e8 of a 3.5mm headphone AUX (out) port (this was just the best thing to find on the rear panel of the TV... ThE BeSt). Which brings me to my next point: speakers. Let's be honest, now; MoSt TVs have garbage for speakers (including many higher priced models). Well, with the ARC connectivity you can HDMI easily to a supporting soundbar or home theater system and with that fiberoptic or the AUX (outs), you can connect the TV sound easily even to older sound systems (just as I did with a Pioneer surround system from 2010). So the factory speakers were not a salepoint to me in the first place and barely affected the star rating at all. If you're looking for the perfect, all-in-1 TV; sound performance & detachable power cord had better not be a high priority for you with this model. However, if you need entertainment in another room from a smaller, better fitting screen size which happens to also support versatile connectivity; then this is the model for you to save some money on. And TV designers & retailers should take note here because many \"smart\" TVs are really a menace to deal with and some people know what they need without the \"smart\" functionalty; so maybe don't forget to stock some normal TVs for shoppers who are sick of how dumb many \"smart\" TVs actually are. Maybe design *ALL* TVs to have a smart *option* which can be used or not or even blocked from functioning so that the device will actually just work like a damned easy-to-use-basic TV. That's what I needed, that's what I found & bought so to me this TV is nothing but value -AnD- it's gravy to hook-up & use! But go get that great, big-ol' expensive picture & spectacular sound with its 1 (maybe 2) HDMI ports. My son is in his bedroom gaming & viewing on a pretty 32\" with surround & it was well below the projected \"son's room entertainment upgrade\" budget which made a happy wifey. *AnD* he loves it because whatever sound the TV should be making is perfectly synced & blasting with surround-depth-of-sound, without blinding him & backlight-bleach-fading the paint off the walls while also potentially causing photo induced seizures & motion sickness. Like I said, nothing but value competetively priced.",

    "text": "The menu button on the remote control works wonders. It controls picture, audio, and more. For audio there are MODES: STANDARD is the default, and in fact a negative review of that mode is justified. BUT there is a MOVIE mode and a MUSIC mode. I was listening to a familiar piano concerto with familiar earphones while testing audio modes. When I got to MUSIC, bingo: sound suddenly as good as I expected. Picture controls for color, brightness, etc are as expected for HDMI DVDs and streaming, AND when using as a PC monitor via VGA, the menu also precisely positions the PC pixel array vertically and horizontally within the 32 inch panel. In other words, the remote control menu greatly improves an initial out-of-the-box experience.",
