{"asin": "ipad", "text": "My old Ipad Pro hasn\u2019t worked for over a year and I also needed a new computer -  but didn\u2019t need anything as sophisticated as a Mac so thought I would try out this 9th Gen Ipad.  So far it does most of what I would do with a larger laptop and has a touchscreen.  I was reluctant to buy Apple tech for quite a few years until I bought a small Iphone SE about 4 years ago - switched from a Samsung Galaxy..  The SE was a great size to carry around the city and it fit in most pockets and had great reception.  It was and still is a great piece of technology.  I upgraded to a 12 after 2 years and still use the SE around the house because it connects to wifi.  The 12 had a better camera and I had toddler granddaughters and after another 2 years I upgraded to the 14 PROMax which has a great camera, larger screen and is not unlike the SE except the bigger size to view photos.  I really love the touchscreen feature for NYTimes games and other interactive apps.  I worry about having most of my pictures on this technology because they could move to a more sophisticated system and make these obsolete - which is a concern. My daughter\u2019s Iphone 13 fell in the snow a few years ago and she somehow lost all her pictures that she thought were in the cloud.  I held on to my 12 because it holds quite a bit of what she lost since we shared their photos.  Neither of us is sure why this happened and if it could happen again.  If I have a stand alone camera it isn\u2019t convenient but I have the photos detached from the technology and the whims of a large multinational behemoth.  So far I am happy with the Ipad and am still learning how to use it.  I found a case that closes securely and  can stand in portrait or landscape mode which is really nice when viewing Netflix or AppleTV.  If you need a new computer to carry conveniently this Ipad is the way to go unless you really need the power and graphic abilities of the MAC.  My Iphone 14maxpro has 256g of memory and I barely use 100 so I thought I would only need 64g on the Ipad since my phone has the extra capacity.  Not convinced this was a great decision but some of my Iphone content can stay there exclusively  so it might just work out.  Or not\u2026..", "title": "Nice IPad.

{"asin": "ipad", "text": "I have had my iPad 9th Generation 64GB Wi-Fi since the end of November, 2022. It has been about 5 months. I upgraded from an iPad Air 2 32GB Wi-Fi (2014 model) that I had for almost 6 years! I have to say that there is a reason why Apple iPads are sold at such a premium price. That's because they provide valuable practical use for far longer than the vast majority of what is available in the tablet market.With that said the 2021 iPad 9th Generation is a base iPad with a limited amount of fancy features and a dated iPad design. Quite frankly, I actually use my iPad on the go and all of the iPads I have had go directly into an Otterbox Defender case. So I hardly notice the little aesthetics in design when my iPads area always in an Otterbox Defender case.I won't make this review long and will highlight the particular reason why I feel the need to write this review at all. I would say there's three top reasons why I believe the iPad 9th generation is excellent: 1. Good CPU performance/64GB base memory capacity, 2. Value pricing, and 3. Apple Pencil/Freeform.1. CPU performance is good with the A13 CPU from the iPhone 11. I am confident that I will be able to use this iPad for at least 4 more years, if not 5. I bought my iPad Air 2 (2014 model) in 2016 and it was supported with OS updates up until iPadOS 15, which is a total of 8 years. But the iPad Air 2 was among the longest supported iPads in Apple's tablet history. So it is not likely to be repeated. But I think that the iPad 9th generation should be supported for at least 6 years, 2021 to 2027. Plus, the 64GB base capacity is excellent for my basic use of the iPad.2. The pricing for the iPad 9th Generation 64GB retails at $329.99, but it is often for sale at $269.99. That's how much I purchased it for during Cyber Monday 2022. It has been on sale for as low as $249.99 at some other retailers as well. So overall, the pricing is very affordable for a device this capable with support for many years to come.3. I know that the Apple Pencil has been out for years, but I have only now tried it. It was not supported with my iPad Air 2 (2014 model) and I never gave it much thought as being useful to me. I always thought that the Apple Pencil was geared towards artists, which to some extent it is. I tried the Apple Pencil on my iPad 9th Generation about a month after getting mine. It was a revolutionary experience for me. I have been looking for a viable substitute for a whiteboard for the longest time. But there is not any real replacement for what you can do on a whiteboard. The Apple Pencil with FreeForm is the closest that I've come to the experience I get on a whiteboard. Although, I do still use a 4'x8' whiteboard for some brainstorming sessions, the Apple Pencil has afforded me to do some basic brainstorming in FreeForm. This is a massive benefit and I can only see Apple getting better with its FreeForm app. Not to mention app developers releasing new apps to take advantage of the Apple Pencil for brainstorming on a virtual whiteboard.Overall, I highly recommend the iPad 9th Generation.", "title": "Apple does it again, the best of Apple in a great price!", "location_and_date": "Reviewed in the United States on March 26, 2023", "verified": true, "rating": "5.0"},

{"asin": "samsung", "text": "I'm upgrading from a Samsung S9, perhaps the best small phone of its era. I loved it. I was skeptical of the S22 because of the negative reviews so I actually bought an iphone 13 pro. That just wasn't any better. The screen wasn't great. It was heavy. Somehow it felt even bulkier than the S22, even though of course Apple \"claims\" essentially the same size specs. Off topic. Back to the issue:I returned the 13 and bought the S22 because I knew I would be frustrated with whatever I bought. I will not buy these jumbo phablet monstrosities. I am a man and it needs to fit in my pocket (under 180 grams, less than 6.25 x 3 x .33). I do not have a purse.And I wanted a flagship camera. So this is it people. If I've missed a phone, please leave me a response!That all said, the S22 apart from the battery, is *amazing.* The pictures are a staggering step up from the S9. The screen is bonkers. Seriously. I know it is lower resolution than the S9, but that is not what is important. This is the best screen I've ever seen. Brightness, accuracy, clarity, depths of blacks, color reproduction. It's amazing. The iPhone 13 pro was noticeable inferior.The S22 is also blazing fast. I don't do any power user stuff like games, but for normal use, every thing is instantaneous - noticeable faster than the S9.  Even Android 12 isn't total #$%@. It works really well so far and has solved many problems I've noticed in the past.Battery: Like I said. I don't have a choice. This phone has the best overall package for me. The iPhone was weak enough that I don't feel like I'm missing out. I've set screen refresh to 60 Hz to save battery life. I expect to get a standard full day out of it. If I'm out in an area with no access to recharge and a high need to make calls (theme park with the family), I will use it sparingly. Frustrating, yes, but not a deal breaker.This phone has made me surprisingly happy. With a true crystal case in the forest green color, it is beautiful. It feels good to hold.

{"asin": "samsung", "text": "Purchased this phone as an international unlocked unit for just over $800 shipped. Shipping was great speed wise but packaging was horrendous. They had the phone in its typical box packaged in another box about 2x the size of the phone box with no supportive packaging (besides 2 deflated air packs, how useless). It was just sliding around willy nilly. The phone seemed to be ok though and I proceeded with using it. My current situation with the phone is that it is set up for the most basic usage. I use it to call, text and use the internet and Facebook messenger. That's about it besides a game I use to play Euchre on, which is rare and I have yet to use it in the week or so I have owned this device. The phones battery is pathetic as compared to the Motorola Moto G 2021 it replaced. This phone with moderate usage will last the work day and a little extra (8 ish am till 10:00 pm), If I am lucky. With light usage it will last that plus till around noon the next day. Additionally, the battery life after it gets under 15% is abysmal. It will go down to 5% within a half hour and then after it hits 5% it just shuts off. The Alarm is annoying as all get out. For whatever reason. I have a SINGLE alarm set. If I want to snooze it and I use the notification pop up to do it instead of the clock app itself it will start ringing again TWICE at the snooze interval, like the alarms are simultaneous and ring just out of sync with each other if snoozed this way. Otherwise the phone does what any other free phone you can get at your local retailer for free with a startup plan. I thought that paying up an additional $450 ish bucks would net me a better device but, I guess I just fell for the flagship phone and I feel like it really was not worth it at this point.

Less intuitive, more \"bloatware\" from samsung, as they feel the need to compete with google on every level. Constantly apps are trying to ask if I would rather use the Samsung version of the app I am already using in endless permission loops with their apps, that don't have a good definition of what the word 'NEVER' means. I am absolutely certain this phone is doing a bunch of processes twice, like saving my contacts and such to google and Samdung. Uploading photos to both clouds, trying to save my credit card info EVERY TIME, etc. Tried to make a quick call while needing to keep my attention elsewhere and the damn thing gave me a dead-end option list of two different phones to use, took me 4 minutes just to start the call after I had completely stopped what I was doing. Sounds confusing? Yeah no kidding. This thing is engineered to be frustrating in the hopes you'll upgrade to a more expensive model in my opinion. The reception is never great, and I have tried 3 different service providers. I constantly pick the phone up to try making a call or to text to discover there is an issue and it's not sending or receiving anything at all until I reboot or reset the network. The feel of it in hand isn't great either for me. I don't come from Iphone, and don't particularly like apple products. Why emulate their design? Gone are the smooth, rounded edges of the s21. This thing is damn close to being a rectangle. It's smaller than the s21 yet somehow feels larger, definitely clunky in comparison. all in all, I have no idea what Samsung was thinking with this phone, this ship has sunk.Edit: Returning this phone due to the worst of these issues: almost every day I notice the phone is unable to send or receive calls or texts until I reboot the phone or network settings. This is a massive inconvenience and a definite deal breaker.(As a side note: I bought a 'burner' from Walmart for temporary use while going through this process to find a good phone, and while it is not nearly as pretty as a flagship phone, I can say however, it does in fact send and receive calls and texts without the need of a daily reboot/reset.

{"asin": "sony", "text": "We have had this camera since 1 June 2021and we purchased it to see if a compact full frame camera would work for us. We were looking for a smaller camera that was not an APS C sensor based camera.First a little background. My wife and I are keen semi professional photographers and own a Canon R5, Canon R6, Nikon Z6 II and Fuji X T4, along with a good selection of Canon RF, Nikon S Z and Fuji XF lenses. I have owned the Sony A7RIII and A7RIV and traded them for the Canon R5 and R6 cameras. We have been taking pictures for over 60 years in my case.I traded the Sony A7RIII and Sony A7RIV simply because I did not like taking pictures with them. Technically they were superb but they were difficult to handle and the new Canons (R5 and R6) were a revelation in handling and I 'wanted' to take pictures with them. I say this because I expected to dislike this A7C. It has the same menu system as the A7RIII and A7RIV (which I did not like) and the comments on the EVF and lack of controls in the reviews made me wonder why I wanted to try this.However it is the size that wins you over immediately. Picture quality is superb and autofocus is excellent. This is a full frame camera in the body of an APS C body and it handles exceptionally well. Somehow those awkward angles etc. of the bigger bodies goes away and it feels so good in both my wife and I's hands. I cannot confirm whether the autofocus is better than the A 7III but it seems the equal of the A 7RIII and A 7RIV, if not a little better (I do not have them to test them side by side but it certainly feels that way). In short we love this camera and, and this is the 'real' test, we tend to take it with us when we are looking to have a camera with us just in case.Pros:1. Small body that feels solid and beautifully made. Access doors are nice quality (not floppy rubber plug in pieces) and fully weather sealed.2. Excellent out of body JPGs, RAWS excellent and easy to recover detail in the shadows and highlights.3. Superb Autofocus that glues to your subject.4. Fast operation.5. Flexible 'flippy' screen.6. Access to a wide range of FE lens mount lenses.7. Kit lens is much better than you would expect and very small. Ideal for street photography and the one lens you might just happen to have with you.8. Excellent battery life.9. Excellent video output.10. In body image stabilization.Cons:1. The EVF is truly awful but just about allows you to aim the camera and take a picture when the rear screen is not viewable.2. Lack of a joy stick is an irritant to me,  but you get used to it.3. Kit lens 60 mm max focal length is too short and the wide angle is not wide enough (28 mm). An equivalent to that Canon RF 24 -105 f/4 - 7.1 would be wonderful.4. The Sony lenses are large for their capabilities (the F/4 24 -105 is enormous), Canon make smaller and better lenses for full frame. However Tamron are filling the gap. We have bought the F/2.8-5.6 28 to 200 mm Tamron for the A 7C and it is a good match, still not small but light and still easy to use and handle.5. IBIS not good enough for video, and needs a gimbal.We love this camera and we use it a lot (we have aleady taken around 4000 shots!!) and used it in a wide variety of conditions where it has excelled.

{"asin": "sony", "text": "The A7c gives me access to next level low light video and photos. This is something that my m4/3 panasonic cameras (G9, G85) struggled to deliver, even just indoors on a sunny day with a nice f2.8 (or even 1.7) lens, the ISO could skyrocket. This was the main motivation for obtaining this camera, and it does not disappoint, with at least a 2-fold improvement in low light performance (max iso set to 3200 and usually sufficient for vids and photos). I am also very impressed by the featherweight budget samyang 18mm f2.8. After testing of many custom presets and getting to grips with some manual focus quirks,  I think I have an A7c  which can do just about everything I need  (stored in the 7 custom camera config preset slots). I can instantly make it into a deluxe GoPro (wide and everything always in focus), low light video Ap/Sp, astro timelapse, day timelapse, low light tracking auto focus stills......... Importantly, it is the same weight as a panasonic G85 which is critical for a travel/backpacking/bike camera (I need). I can put it on the crane M2 mini-gimbal for decent stabilization, and still be discrete/small enough to not feel like a sore thumb. This is the deal when you move from panny m4/3 - I swapped low light performance for effective stabilization. The catalyst giro stabe in post is a bit last resort, but a nice thought.  It is awesome to have access to the older manual FF lenses -  budget great glass - without all the crop factor PITA with m4/3 or APS-c. The big downside of this camera is lack of any intuitive user interface - it will do it all - but wow - it is quite a learning curve to test and set up this stuff. I guess you get out what you put in. As a panasonic G9  shooter (camera with very nice user interface),  the HUGE elephant in the room is usability and the lack of a touch screen. Compared to the G9 this camera has very poor organization and on-the-fly tweakability. The workaround here is extensive testing and the use of personal menus and custom presets, but even then the lack of a touch screen for at least review is just criminal. In summary, this camera really delivers full frame dazzle, is a good fit for light weight adventures (only with the additional M2 gimbal and lightweight lens), but IMO needs real commitment  from any non-sony shooter to get the preset settings dialed in and make it all work.9 month update --  removed a star to 4/5: in the end the lack of workable IBIS, touch screen and very fiddly menus caused me to give up with this camera.  For the way I shoot video (stopped down, lots of manual) the Sony AF was not as valuable as I expected. I found it was not so great at f>5, and with low contrast scenes (snow, landscapes).  I acquired a Panasonic S5, and so far its working perfectly for me.", "title": "Sony A7c: no limits full frame compact camera (if you know the options.........)", "location_and_date": "Reviewed in the United States on April 10, 2021", "verified": true, "rating": "4.0"},

{"asin": "sony", "text": "There are many technical reviews on this camera that is better than anything I can say here.  I wanted a camera mainly for video and would like to share how I came to chose the 7c.  There are lots of other choices, but this checks all the important marks that I was looking for.  I started fresh without any prior lens and accessories.  I first evaluated which brand and system of camera I want.  The industry is moving towards larger full frame sensors.  There's Sony, Canon, and Fuji.  I feel that Sony is the leader in product development and innovation.  So I went with them.  I could have bought the 7siii, but the 7c is much much more compact and at this point fits my need.  I could have chosen the a6600, but I think the full frames have better picture, especially in low light.  And is a better upgrade path towards other Sony full frames in the future.  I could have gone with a GH5, but that's a much larger camera with sucky focus and low light performance.  And though I like Canon, they don't have a full frame in this size.  They have better lens selection for sure, but I feel they are not quite as innovative.So for my compact video travel rig, I have the 7c with one set of lens...the Tamron 17-14mm.  For audio I bought the Sony eco-81m shotgun mic.  This mic operates in digital mode, and powers off the 7c battery so no extra cord or battery to worry about.  So far it's been the perfect system for me.  I do have larger hands so the grip is just a bit small.  I ended getting the Smallrig cage. I was worried this might add bulk to my system, but it fits like a glove and adds no perceivable bulk.  It adds protection as well as gives me a much better grip surface.I love my set up.  It has everything I want in a travel video camera.", "title": "Great compact travel camera", "location_and_date": "Reviewed in the United States on January 28, 2021", "verified": true, "rating": "5.0"},
{"asin": "sony", "text": "Throughout the years I\u2019ve owned the a7RII and the a6500 and this camera has combined to become the one camera body to rule them all for my uses. I always loved the size/weight of the a6500 but hated the crop sensor limits especially with available third party lenses. Well now I have a ultra compact FF camera body that is just as portable and discreet as the APS-C lineup of cameras which fits my needs perfectly.I am not a professional photographer or vlogger but just a casual photo hobbyist so this camera might not work for everyone and my views are coming from my level of experience. With that said there is one big thing that annoys me most about this camera vs the a7 lineup and that\u2019s not having a front scroll wheel on the grip (that was stupid\u2026why Sony\u2026WHY?!) and far fewer customizable buttons vs the a6XXX lineup. Had Sony merged those two items into this camera body it would be a 5 star home run. I\u2019m learning to live within the new limited perimeters of the camera itself and adapt to the different layout and lack of customization but it is a different experience than I was used to on both previous camera body setups.Anyway, if you can get passed those shortcomings and want a small body with a FF sensor then this is your only option. The small manual lenses that can be used with a cheap adapter available on eBay are plentiful and ultra cheap (Minolta 55mm f/1.7\u2026..$40 on eBay) and having programmed a custom button for manual focus zoom and using focus peaking you can get excellent pictures that are incredibly sharp wide open with this camera. My general recommendation is for people to not be afraid to use manual focus lenses. Once you get used to them you can be just as fast as the autofocus on a Sony branded lens that is 5-20 times the price.Speaking of autofocus\u2026the eye autofocus and autofocus abilities is the exact same tech as found in the a7SIII camera so it is incredible and according to reviews I\u2019ve watched/read it is much improved over the competing a7III as well.", "title": "Exactly what I needed!", "location_and_date": "Reviewed in the United States on June 4, 2021", "verified": true, "rating": "4.0"},

Sony Alpha 7C is the most compact full-frame mirrorless available in the market. Its lightness and well-balanced body help you carry it wherever you go without any second thought. Its uncompromising capability and quality let you obtain the highest quality images and videos anywhere and at any moment. I would recommend this camera for people who want to upgrade from crop body, serious about recording your lifestyle, content creator, professionals who need a second body.Swivel screenThis is the second Sony full-frame camera with an articulating screen. Another one that has this screen costs much more. It changes the game in the sense that you have much more freedom in your shot angle and also monitor yourself for the self-shot without any other accessories.Sony Auto Focus TrackingAutofocus and Video focus tracking are out of this world. You will not sacrifice shots that are out of the focus. Especially, Auto tracking enabled in the video makes this camera best for the Vlog. The enhancement on the screen brightness is an upgrade from a7m3. Some suggest viewfinder is a downgrade, but I had no problem with it. I also like how detail you can adjust focus transition speed to make it more cinematic. I wanted it to have an updated Sony menu system, but it has the previous generation touch menu system with a menu button in a weird location.Video reliabilityThis is also a great camera for video recording with unlimited video recording minutes. You can make a professional-quality video for any type of conference or lecture. I see this can be even a great sub-camera for the professionals to have that reliable second and third view of the recording.New Compact bundle LensSony created a new FE 28-60mm F4-5.6 compact lens to go in hand with Sony A7C. I took several shots with this lens and it was a pleasant surprise. I usually do not have any high hopes for the bundled lens and especially the small lens.

{"asin": "alienware", "text": "Extremely disappointed in Dell for the quality of this machine. The computer is defective and dangerous.Last week I purchased the computer brand new and it arrived in sealed box in \u201cperfect\u201d condition. Booted up with no issues and I proceeded to update with necessary drivers and software. A few hours later I go to turn off the computer and I pick up the power adapter and burn myself. Could not pick the adapter for about a half hour as it was much too hot to touch. Thought this was strange.The next day I boot up the computer again to see what happens to the power adapter. I do some light gaming for a few hours (all in-game graphics settings were set as default and profile of the graphics card was set to balanced with no over clocking). I finish and turn off the computer and again the power adapter is way too hot to touch. I then go to move the computer and touch the area above the function keys and subsequently burn myself again. What is going on\u2026The third day is testing day. Armed with a digital infrared thermometer, I now have the tools to see how hot things are getting. Before booting up I scan the surface of the power adapter and area around the keyboard. All check out fine around room temperature ~72 degrees. I then boot up and repeat the same process as the previous day and after an hour I test. The surface of the power adapter (located unobstructed on the floor, no clutter around it) checks in at 150 degrees, and the backside on the floor checks in even hotter. Next I test around the surface of the computer (the entire unit including the fans and vents are unobstructed with the closet obstruction several feet away). The area above the function keys checks in over 140 degrees. Areas on the sides and corners above the fans check in around 120-130 degrees. The keyboard itself is over 110. Not good.The next day things take a drastic turn. After the tests of the previous day I shutdown the computer but this time I left the power adapter plugged into the wall and plugged into the computer overnight (previously I had been disconnecting these). I attempt to turn on the computer but it does not turn on. I then touch the keyboard and surface and am surprised as it is very warm, and the power adapter is also very warm. Further testing reveals the power adapter to be over 100 degrees and the area above the keyboard to be over 120 degrees. So now not only does the computer not boot, but it is also heating up to unacceptable levels when it is shutdown and plugged in. Further, after unplugging the power adapter to the shutdown computer and waiting 30 minutes, the unit still remains hot with surfaces over 120 degrees in some places.After evaluating all of the evidence (the two burns on my hands, the temperature readings, the computer settings, and the failure to boot) my verdict is that this machine is defective and dangerous. Burning oneself is bad enough, but this unit has the potential to cause far more damage. I do not feel comfortable keeping this machine inside my house and potentially putting the lives of my family at risk as I have no doubt that this computer is a dangerous fire hazard.I paid thousands of dollars for this computer and am extremely disappointed and frustrated that Dell would produce such a poor quality and dangerous product. I will be attempting to return/exchange this unit and luckily I am covered under the return grace period and manufacturers warranty. I also purchased the extended warranty as well and would recommend this to anyone making a purchase like this.

Solved with a new adapter.Other than these, no problems at all, and I found it easier to fix myself rather than send it back and pick another one.  With the above caveats I can still recommend this PC as a good useable machine for my daily driver.  The WIFI was probably a fluke and not a common problem, and you may not be affected as I was by the keyboard.  I say \"Go for it\"!", "title": "Great PC, terrible keyboard", "location_and_date": "Reviewed in the United States on August 11, 2022", "verified": true, "rating": "4.0"},

{"asin": "pavillion", "text": "OK, I broke my cardinal rule of making a purchase of a product with zero reviews. Looks like I will get to start things off. On a bang for your buck scale, this item looks pretty good! I ordered it without relying on feedback from anyone. I was salivating over the arrival of my new play-pretty and was delighted to find that delivery was ahead of schedule! It arrived this morning and was handed to me by the Amazon driver. There was no apparent damage to the outer or inner packaging.As per the description, I was aware that the product would not be sealed because the product had been upgraded with a larger SSD drive as well as a memory upgrade. Everything seemed to be in order so I charged it for a few hours and gathered the info I would need to make it my own. This was to be a replacement for my old laptop that had finally surrendered.Windows 11 welcomed me and I proceeded to start jumping through the multiple hoops required of me by my friends at Microsoft. About halfway through, the screen went blank. That should have been a warning. But, nerd wanna-be that I am, said 'meh'...Let's restart it and see what happens...Long story; short...After MANY restarts, blue screens, blank screens, driver updates, google searches, and no lack of consternation, I decided that it was time to cut my losses and try again.At this point, I had already managed to share some of my information into the operating system and other areas of this machine, so I needed to purge that before I returned it to folks unknown. After the third reset, one actually completed and I am hopeful that it is clean now.The good folks at Amazon (politics notwithstanding) have always been super to work with and they really do take care of their customers! I know how new products can have their glitches, and that beta testers are sometimes customers. I am hopeful that I can update this review with glorious praise for the seller and the product!

It is not nor does its makers claim it to be a premium product, but those who want premium performance should cough up the premium price for it. For the hundred bucks you do pay for this phone you get your money's worth, and a bit more. It's reliable, sturdy, and has the essentials you should expect for calls, on-line access, texting, and running most apps. The camera is not great and while I'm not much of a gamer, I don't expect that it would run the latest games with great efficiency. But this is a device I'd get for someone who wants basic Android functionality and is not interested in paying for all the bells and whistles of high-end brands. It's fine for less tech-centric people, and if you have a kid who wants a phone that handles the fastest games and demanding video, give him or her the hundred bucks that this one costs and tell them to go get an after-school job or solicit odd jobs for neighbors to raise the extra five, six, nine hundred or more dollars to get it.
